okay here ' s the down side of the espn deal no additional coverage with a split contract sca could have at least gotten at leftovers like canucks jets caps whoever and red wings leafs or whoever else is playing for our area islanders devils it ' s likely to be the bruins since the other adams series is montreal quebec i ' d prefer the latter myself i ' m under the impression that the abc deal overrides the local deals but if st louis at chicago pops up we ' ll know gld

here ' s a summary of don cherry ' s coach ' s corner from april qqq qqq the game being broadcast in my region was la and calgary although i think it was filmed during the toronto detroit game that night warning anti fighting people may want to skip this post topics don ' s tie grant fuhr penalties wings vs leafs fighting dale hunter episode summary this episode began with the camera zoomed in on don ' s tie don was pointing out the characters on the tie bugs bunny foghorn leghorn and yosemite sam who don called lanny macdonald ron maclean began by mentioning that don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night ' s games because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of hunter and fuhr don began to praise fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and said that he ' s winning the series against boston all by himself he then showed clips from earlier episodes nov qqq jan qqq when fuhr was still with the leafs and don advised do n ' t trade fuhr don went on to predict that if buffalo gets by boston it would be fuhr who wins the series muckler took a lot of heat for the trade but don feels muckler ' s been vindicated the next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls he showed a clip from a winnipeg vancouver game where domi hit a vancouver player and was given a qqq min penalty ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved but don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with domi hitting the vancouver player with his shoulder don its sad what they ' re doing for hockey a qqq minute penalty for a nosebleed next they went to the playoff series between detroit and toronto people in detroit were calling wendel clarke wendy for not fighting however don pointed out that probert was not fighting either this lead don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking it ' s like college hockey the little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody that ' s why you ' re seeing so much stickwork because they know you wo n ' t drop your gloves and give them a shot the rules are made by people who do n ' t know what ' s going on in hockey the final topic don discussed was dale hunter don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip of hunter from a previous game when he was younger hunter was taught to play to win which differs from today ' s idea of just letting kids have fun at then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coach ' s corner with the tape on fast forward so that don sounded like one of the chipmunks rating typical anti fighting posturing not too much humour but some good quotes i ' d give it a qqq out of qqq | allan sullivan allan @ cs . ualberta . ca | department of computing science _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | university of alberta edmonton alberta canada _ \ ___ # ___ _ | my opinions are mine and mine alone it is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit u of a golden bears hockey motto c drake )

this would be dumb move of the nineties lindros is big and strong but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the other to drag along not if pocklington gets there first actually if pocklington does n ' t get a better deal he would probably go to hamilton taking the team out of canada would get the whole country mad at him taking the team to hamilton would n ' t get anybody mad at him that is n ' t mad at him already and would make him a lot of friends in southern ontario so many that the whining of the stupid politicians in edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans would n ' t be noticed at all edmonton would wallow in anonymnity .
as the sharks season came to a close tonight i will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through for the sharks for the past season if you are uninterested since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them i will first try to evaluate how the players did these ratings of course are subject to my own biases but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and / or did not play for another nhl team this season thus then let ' s go to the goaltenders qqq brian hayward season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade p d it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies with patrick roy in qqq qqq and qqq it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the qqq string goalie but hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the sharks first ever victory the qqq game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was qqq jeff hackett season qqq acquired qqq qqq from n y islanders in expansion draft grade c hackett after deservedly winning the team mvp honors last season simply wasted the year other than a few good spots qqq saves against los angeles almost shutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing with qqq save percentage and a qqq gaa watched his status go from the team ' s qqq goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season he was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss qqq games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply was n ' t up to the task he may not return next year qqq wade flaherty season qqq still eligible as rookie acquired qqq qqq signed as undrafted free agent grade i a it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the calgary flames flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods he started the season poorly in kansas city but finished strong prompting the blades owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs picking up all star honors along with irbe now it ' s time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospects dan ryder trevor robins and scott cashman coming along if he does n ' t make it next year he may not ever qqq arturs irbe season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he ' s a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide qqq goaltender he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had getting the team ' s first ever shut out against the los angeles kings on december qqq he has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbe ' s the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game qqq times in qqq starts .
any more news on steve ' s status since he lost the starting job would be appreciated
i recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various players that were coming into the nhl i got this particular card of a russian named viktor kozlov it says many scouts believe he will be the qqq pick in qqq another guy is quoted as saying he ' s as good as mario lemieux anyone know who this guy is ?
i personally will never forget mike schmidt ' s home run against the expos in qqq that decided the nl east it was also his career high qqq .
this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary very scary do n ' t get me wrong i m a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in qqq spring training that basically killed their chances of course do n ' t forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game ?
so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw the rule book certainly does n ' t have a definiton or clarification so it ' s possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner then again we have interference you know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance of being ejected therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him you should note that in our american legion league which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule qqq .
this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news they argued that if you ' re going to play havoc with the schedule you should at least make sure that prime time is aired as soon as possible news got a commitment that the post game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within one minute or so of the game ending as for the earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the west ca nt see the leafs and people in central canada ca n ' t see the jets game the reason for the decision was cbc ' s feeling they could n ' t sell advertising for six hours of hockey in one night as for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people cbc always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule .
right so who cares which player gets credited as long as the team gets more runs if a player helps the team get more r and rbi but does n ' t score them all himself who cares consider player a single player b grounder to short reaches on the force at qqq player c double b to qqq player d sac fly b gets a run d gets an rbi are you sure they helped the team more than a and c think hard now as you wish .
speaking of great players man oh man can quebec skate i have n ' t seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time watching them break out of their zone especially sundin is a treat to watch they remind me of the red army dchhabra @ stpl . ists . ca pissed off habs fan yeah the nords look like they ' re going to be good but excuse the bias have you ever watched the pens on a rush don ' t answer everyone has seen this footage near the end of the season when the pens played the nords it was like watching a younger double of the pens the nords looked good right up to the point when they lost ravi shah shah @ pitt . edu
stuff about upated inning scores deleted at just that exact time to see the message even results after the game is over are not necessary thanks to mr hernandez who posts daily standings and results here every day am i supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down just wondering it was meant entirely qqq as a compliment i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet especially for those in the east coast who ca n ' t get final scores for west coast games in their newspapers or late tv newscasts this is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week also many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through bbs ' s or some pay news services by the way mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions i was not trying to criticize your service at all in fact i was trying to encourage others to use it i do n ' t personally use it but i ' m sure others do and that was my point in posting there is no need for individuals to duplicate in an ad hoc fashion what you have already organized if you want to send updates and scores set up a private mailing list and use that remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec . sport . baseball newsgroup other than that everything is done through private e mail currently there are qqq people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others and the list grows by an average of qqq people a day having one person such as yourself who does it is a great idea having qqq do it is not that ' s all keep up the good work joseph .

ted you ' re missing a vital point as roger lustig pointed out in a previous response the reason why schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis such thoughts affected her hiring practices bonilla on the other hand was found to have mentioned this one word a single time if he had been known to go around criticizing homosexuals it would be a different story furthermore he is merely an athlete he does n ' t have to hire anyone as schott had to do dave pallone the former nl umpire who is an admitted homosexual has decided to assist in a protest before a mets game at shea he like you thinks that bonilla should be suspended from baseball pallone is hoping for a year ' s suspension in my opinion that ' s downright ludicrous as howie rose on wfan said if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions then you ' d probably have enough people remaining to play a three on three game now honestly if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article i would think that you ' d reconsider your thoughts - sean

imho clement although he has a pleasant personality aggravatingly pleasant in my opinion is a terrible analyst because he is almost alway wrong the prototypical example being new jersey ' s first goal last sunday i grew up with dick irvin doing color beside danny gallivan i knew did irvin dick irvin was a friend of mine bill clement you are n ' t any dick irvin as long as the teams involved do not include the us national team or the new york rangers i ' d take john davidson over bill clement any day .

you want to speed up ballgames qqq enforce the two minutes between innings as it is many fields are allowing three minutes between them fifteen seconds before tv commercials are gone to thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game two minutes last out to first pitch or a ball is called qqq do n ' t grant time to batters just because they want it they may get pissed at first but they ' ll get in line once anything the pitcher throws while they ' re adjusting their wristbands is a strike qqq mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches the current rule is too lenient and then enforce it fifteen seconds is more than enough time if the pitch is n ' t released in qqq call it a ball and restart the clock baseball games take about qqq in the nl and just a shade under qqq hours in the al that ' s just too damn long i do n ' t like to play in qqq hour games much less watch a game for that long my butt falls asleep and if i ' m watching on tv i ' ll channel surf between pitches catching colorized versions of mr ed leave it to beaver and those wacky nieporents on nick at nite .

yep though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simple last year i woofed when we went up qqq qqq on the canucks and look where it got me domi got tossed in the qqq with a high sticking major he had been playing with kris king and stu barnes and it was this line that was arguably the best in the first two games definitely a good thing every little cheer helps evan good thing the net does n ' t need a voice to operate i wo n ' t have one sunday night when i get home i hope white noise here we come one thing i will say though vancouver can keep steve armitage and john garrett as a broadcast team those two are bad especially when you are spoiled by don wittman at least four or five times steve called barnes selanne whoops )
i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis as they had little talent on their roster for some time steve avery for example was rushed to the majors and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his qqq era during his rookie year bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound bob horner was also rushed to the majors out of arizona state directly had good numbers immediately i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith craig mcmurty and derek lilliquist the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed lilliquist and smith struggled but it did n ' t hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped i seem to recall cm pitching well initially though i do n ' t have stats handy .

i watched the game germany czechs in wc today and i was astonished about the behaviour of the german audience the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rink is that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the isostar bros gave the german team a penalty for that but it did n ' t help much i guess the germans just are proud over their nazi kill ' em all everyone but us germans sucks attitude they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer it really pisses me off i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but most of them seem to do .
this brings up a question i asked myself no answer when it was mentionned that the nhl could expand in europe would most of the north americans now playing in the nhl be willing to play for a team in europe i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved remember these lindros did not want to play in quebec for more than reasons nicholls in edmonton r courtnall wanted to be traded to la only c lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year i know there are many non cultural reasons behind these but there is more some american players who played for the expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities one players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved to london spain etc for the one year of that new football league qqq years ago i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe myself i would like to see some european teams but what would be the best way to do it ?

okay i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can so the no power impatient guys have no excuse the no power patient guys are doing the right thing now the impatient power guys how could you leave out the big cat would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches perhaps but i doubt it if you tell joe carter to go up there and take a few pitches he will draw more walks but he also wo n ' t hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive the patient power guys joe morgan had a small strike zone and rickey henderson has a strike zone the size of hitler ' s heart so they get their walks based on the small zone look at the other qqq guys thomas bonds mcgwire ruth and williams wow a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them the pitchers would do better in my opinion by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch but pitchers would rather nibble go qqq qqq or qqq qqq and then get hurt .

i think the three headed gm ' s guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage at the end of last season the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions fenton bozek anderson and a couple others i ca n ' t remember were bought out the idea was that youngsters could play almost as well and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not and they traded mullen because he wanted to go not because he was n ' t good enough but i think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions an example from this season skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept because of his age i thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around the youth movement has its advantages look at gaudreau who might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around but you have to find the right balance .
i have no idea nor do i care however i ' d like to point out that blomberg got the first plate appearance by a designated hitter and the first walk by a designated hitter i am not sure but i do not think that he also got the first hit by a designated hitter .
these new rule changes are great however i think that your rules are much too complicated how will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has and then we would even have to remember the names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul and of course there will have to be new sub positions like the power center who just sits in the slot until the blue of course puck comes near him and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman finally we ' ll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty shot takers since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled we ' ll be able to see ulf samuellson sp and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy keith keller let ' s go rangers let ' s go quakers kkeller @ mail . sas . upenn . edu ivy league champs !

yeah but what ' s your point you still need the offense to score more runs than you allow too the braves do have a fine pitching staff but that ' s still only half the game .
i ' ve been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the net for a while i figured i ' d stick my neck out a bit the royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an al team since the inception of the dh rule p . s any ideas what this is they will fall easily short of qqq runs that ' s for damn sure i ca n ' t believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our tom gage of the detroit news claiming herk robinson is some kind of genius for the trades aquisitions he ' s made c ya sean
it ' s about time the boys got it together they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear or is that high gear in game qqq except for a qqq qqq minute stretch in the qqq period they outskated and outworked the wings please do n ' t flame this statement ' cos you know it ' s true i have to admit that goaltending was the key potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the leafs went through in the qqq he also kept the rebounds to a minimum something that cost cheveldae qqq goals clark even looked like he had stopped moping first star although i still do n ' t know why he was so flat in games qqq and qqq if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game qqq they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance but a chance i ' m no rm where is he anyways haha .

maybe i can help you he ' s a major league coach with the rockies so above prediction is doubly wrong my prediction the red sox cubs series and vikings broncos superbore will occur at the end of the world and one rockie will finish in the top qqq of an offensive catagory this year and no rockie starter will have an era below qqq and the rangers fade will not begin until august they ' ll give way to the angels but still challenge to the end really not making any of this up if i am may god strike me down zzzzzzt *
i can only comment on the kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but he ' s clearly much more than that great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate in fact he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best he ' s only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but i ' d prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the league ' s premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we ' ll let in fewer goals than hartford honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel jon
oh really i seem to remember this year ' s woofers consisting mainly of yourself and roger boston fans were relatively quiet i guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you could n ' t possible understand eh nah i doubt you really would you ' re just being a provocative sob as usual with a large stick up your but of course i mean that in the nicest way and just how much bragging did you do wobbie on r . s . b . c after umass beat your quakers btw congratulations should go to the sabres they are playing more diciplined and with more will to win they deserve it .

how was this trade bad i seem to recall ratelle and middleton making a pretty good centre right wing combination and the bruins also got brad park in the deal and they also lost vadnais and somebody else after the trade the bruins were in two finals and one semi final all of which of course they lost to montreal which should please you to no end i doubt however keeping esposito would have made a difference in those series as he did not for the rangers in qqq or any of his years in boston for that matter riston riston
i have been to all qqq isles caps tilts at the crap centre this year all isles wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world he could n ' t hit a bull in the ass with a banjo al must remember a few years back when mick scored qqq goals in one period against the caps in a qqq qqq isles win i was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd wake up al years later he ' s gotten worse he ' s a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid senseless penalties i think he would make a good police officier as for pilon he ca n ' t carry the puck out to center ice by himself he either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater he ca n ' t stay on his skates with most forwards or centers he either falls down or committs a penalty call up somebody from capital district al as far as the playoffs the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps two good teams with talent but so inconsistent they should meet in the first round the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against jersey tonite it ' ll probably be another tight qqq game as the last qqq games hve been for the isles i wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game al must understand he ca n ' t do with this team what he did with the qqq qqq isles maybe al should got to where is bobby nystrom clark gilles john tonelli these are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench fire al john scialdone scialdone @ nssdca . gsfc . nasa . gov

this is certainly not the case there is no significant ability toi perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game winning hit the clutch pitching quoted above is something which happened not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher simple statistics tell me that there is a qqq chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is qqq points standard deviation about qqq there will be such hitters in any league just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays and there is only a very weak correlation qqq in my best study between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability based only on this data i do n ' t see any reason to pinch hit for sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage any portion of sabo ' s clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves ?

i do n ' t buy this at all i think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are try this exercise xxx is pitching today his team scores qqq in the first inning and qqq in the fourth xxx gives up qqq in the qqq through qqq in the fifth he gives up qqq runs in the qqq he gives up qqq more the score is now qqq qqq with xxx ' s team still on top i contend that if xxx were jack morris the assessment would be he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win if xxx were mike trmbley the assessment would be he is an inexperienced rookie who does n ' t know how to pitch needs more seasoning send him to aaa or to the spice rack "
it was unlikely improbable for the bruins it was the stuff of nightmares for the sabres it was a taste of heaven for the first time since qqq the sabres have won the first three games of a series last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the canadiens it takes a little more work this time the sabres seem ready to put in the extra work on the heels of a shutout one that took away boston ' s home ice advantage the sabres came back with a four to three overtime win it was n ' t easy it was n ' t always pretty it still worked john blue got the nod for boston supplanting andy moog as starting goaltender moog was pulled midway through game qqq on tuesday buffalo started with a goal by mogilny his fourth of the playoffs on the powerplay with boston ' s don sweeney and gord roberts in the box lafontaine and hawerchuk had the assists goal number two was khmylev ' s first of the playoffs a pretty goal scored when the sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting khmylev smehlik and hannan assisted determined not to be shut out boston tallied on a shot by ray bourque on the powerplay with colin patterson and bob sweeney both in the box period two was scoreless a split of penalties between the two clubs the third saw boston ' s smolinski get his first courtesy of oates buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later from former bruin bob sweeney khmylev and carney neely tied the game qqq of the way through the third sending it into overtime last year overtime meant a bruin win last night it spelled sweet revenge as buffalo scored with ray bourque in the penalty box on a tip in by khmylev hawerchuk and lafontaine a minute into overtime both teams finished with qqq shots power play conversions boston qqq qqq buffalo qqq qqq referee rob shick comments shick pocketed the whistle in the third allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing buffalo ' s penalty killing unit was fantastic again mogilny was checking granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards but checking like this is a novel idea to mogilny the crowd was unbelievable i do n ' t think i ' ve ever heard a crowd that loud in the aud for a sabres game remember i was only five when they played for the cup i do n ' t remember it and no one took me to the games doug bodger in a postgame interview noted that he tried to say something to hawerchuk but the crowd was too loud even though he was shouting it did n ' t seem to matter as most of the sabres and even muckler said it was great yuri khmylev did n ' t seem to realize that he was the game ' s third star and did n ' t skate out when his name was called sweeney qqq and fuhr qqq each were out before yuri made his appearance sans jersey when asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was he responed yes ok it was through an interpreter and he said more than that even more than the interpreter said but i digress the interviewer seemed to think just because he does n ' t speak english he must not understand playoffs uh huh .
imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by today ' s rules in all of baseball my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher can not pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on deck circle also the lead a pitcher enters with can not excede three runs i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners savers etc for instance a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win has this pitcher earned a win no way i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win the third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat satisfaction mike
as i have read this net the last few days i am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals especially when it comes down to saying that the bosox have n ' t a prayer as a long time red sox fan i will simply say the impossible dream year qqq for those of you with short memories short lives or both to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow the hot team this statement is supported based on the increased number of brave woofers out on the net a true fan of a team any team will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years and be amply rewarded when the time is right yeah so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in qqq who cares if clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower the fact is they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them now that it appears that they are on lean times the number of detracters come from all over so what let them play and we will see what happens come september the red sox may not be that good but they are certainly not that bad either and they do have a chance to win the world series after all remember the qqq mets who would have given them a chance to even make it that far let alone beat baltimore let ' s face it baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football and basketball because of this one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of qqq games .
well after suffering from an intense fit of minnesota induced cabin fever i ' ve decided to road trip to milwaukee and take in a couple of games this weekend a couple games at county stadium will be great to relieve tension but i thought why not go to wrigley for a game too i see the cubs are playing the phillies on sat qqq start i believe that ' s eastern time listed i figured it would be fun to bounce down to wrigley for the day game and live it up a little i ' m wondering if anyone esp cubbie fans have some advice on qqq if i ' m taking qqq skokie hwy south until it runs into qqq what ' s the best way to get to wrigley i ' m planning on getting there an hour or two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy qqq is it probable that i ' ll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats qqq or qqq on game day i figure since it ' s early in the year ryno ' s out and the weather is n ' t great i should be able to get tickets if not what ' s the best way to get advance tickets can i call the cubs ticket office directly and pick up tickets at the will call window qqq any advice on where to eat before or after the game qqq do they allow inflatable i luv ewe dolls present from lundy into the bleachers )
while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis joseph when a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do joseph should be given the entire city of st louis because otherwise there would probably be a game qqq scheduled as for the game on sunday the blues caught a few breaks without a doubt one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties second the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear no linesman no shot for brett ( i can redirect anything ) hull to redirect on another of st louis goals belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who did n ' t belong in the crease which means it was a st louis player finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease no goalie no way to stop the shot i congratulate st louis for beating the hawks it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph wo n ' t be able to stop the powerful red wing attack _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

well i got ta tell ya last night ' s leafs game vs the devils was a nail bitter let me tell you it was a well played game by both teams i thought but according to the don and ron it was the an off night for the leafs and the devils were outplaying toronto well i beg to differ imho clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did his fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the clark of old but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour i think the leafs are playing great hockey why well first look at their injury list which includes cullen ellet zezel macoun of course my question is this how will the leafs fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well so far second just look at their standings still second in defence moved from qqq overall to qqq over in the last month have n ' t lost at home in last qqq games qqq game undefeated streak etc btw am i wrong or was this potvin ' s first shut out i ca n ' t remember him having any as of yet well as of april qqq we see that the race for first in the norris has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one coming to the stretch and still a roar ' in go leafs go !

nice try deepak but tough whaler squad should have clued you in to the fact that my leaf woofing was tongue in cheek if playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least qqq consecutive times in qqq days and hockey being the contact sport that it is some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season but that is only for some of the players many of the rest who have been playing with injuries who miss their families or who like grant fuhr would really rather be playing golf do n ' t really give a damn of course i ca n ' t say this for sure but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i do n ' t think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically human attitudes with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs the ones who regard the playoff take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs now i know some of you are going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all while they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose which is to make a decent living of course the coach is a professional as well and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players so if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort the second season is after all merely an exhibition the true champions of the league are the division winners the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season the stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot the emphasis on the playoffs with their sudden death appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind even if pittsburgh loses the playoffs we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year they proved it cordially as always rm
well yeah on the other hand for the first few years of his career he looked like herb washington dan gladden does n ' t seem to suck defensively either yeah and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career it ' s actually not an uncommon phenomenon and how long a guy hangs around based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a racial basis hey he plays for lou gorman does n ' t he ok so it ' s eight years good point on cedeno otoh i have n ' t seen that extensive list of qqq dan gladdens either there really are n ' t that many players altogether who hang around for qqq years even if they ' re reasonably good mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com

i ' ve been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place sure it ' s been cold the food lines were long and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the giants mystique or so i thought i went to tuesday ' s game qqq qqq giants over the marlins and the stick was a much different place nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but everything is a lot better the lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are clean and have running water and the hired hands were very polite the new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence are very nice as are the new bleachers the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view and they ' ve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers the only complaint is that the electronic old fashioned scoreboard looks electronic could be better these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real businessman ex safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just like he used to tell his checkers if the customers do n ' t come back i do n ' t need as many checkers this is n ' t a knock on bob lurie he was a competent businessman but he did n ' t deal much with the general public i ' ll give an example of how the level of service has changed the onion dispenser jammed as i was using it an attendant came over apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine after he was done he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help in the old days there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to the stand qqq feet away they might be able to help all in all it was a fun day
i wondered the same thing when he first mentioned it i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over and then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded so since stats never lie i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion .
i have n ' t seen enough royals games to judge his tactics so you may have a point here but imo the royals do n ' t have a chance to win the pennant even if mcrae suddenly began channeling for john mcgraw ok they have some decent pitchers but when your offense consists of bums like gagne and lind and mcreynolds and mcrae and an over the hill brett you ' re not going to finish qqq unless mcgraw brings christy mathewson back with him i ' d say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck .

i have n ' t seen anyone post this so i will do the honors maine beat lssu qqq qqq in milwaukee on saturday night it was quite a game maine stormed to a qqq qqq lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it maine ' s first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game lssu came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to qqq qqq lssu came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards the play went quickly with the refs running a no holds barred type of game lssu scored three more unanswered goals to lead qqq qqq at the end of the second now it looked like lssu might just walk away with the game coach walsh of maine replaced the starting goalie dunham with snow who won the game against michigan snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie the third period like the second belonged to the team behind maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark they were all scored by jim montgomery the tournament mvp and all assisted by paul kariya the last minute of the game bears highlighting the change to snow also proved the difference in the end with one minute to go and with the lssu goalie pulled snow dueled with a lssu forward in a amazing set of moves by both snow won it was a great way to end the game this year ' s three championships games were sold out last year in about one month the bradley center holds approximately qqq .

here is my traditional experience with tickets playoffs and otherwise at the civic arena scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the arena best strategy given that you do n ' t mind missing the anthem which is ok if b . e taylor decides to come back ever again is to wait until qqq or qqq when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on what ' s left at qqq may be nosebleed material d e sections others can add on their opinions as well .

my apologies for the typo i meant the wings had qqq power plays in the first period and the leafs none as well my point is n ' t that the refs were biased just that they were calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the wings having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game .
depends on what you mean by classy from what i ' ve heard about him he was about as classy as harold ballard only difference was that back then almost all the owners were like that so he seemed okay by comparison read the book net worth for one view of what smythe and norris and adams and campbell were like even more specifically i think what roger was saying and i said it previously too is that these are not the people who made the league great so why should divisions conferences etc be named after them instead of morenz vezina howe orr etc the people who did make it great instead the nhl has chosen to immortalize the men who got rich off of the men who made the game great .

he ' s a canadian thing former coach of the boston bruins and colorado rockies from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the u . s and european programs after he left the rockies he got a job with cbc ' s hockey night in canada and has n ' t looked back since actually he did work for cbc at least on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated i ' d say it ' s a combination of flame bait and serious journalism the closest thing you ' ll find to cherry in the u . s is stan fischler a self described hockey maven the similarities are that they both say things that get people upset the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler does n ' t don ' s a character if he were completely rational and noncontroversial he would n ' t have a job by some definitions he could be called an ass but then some people feel the same about mike lang another character that i wish would get wider exposure only one national telecast last year .

and some comments with some players deleted yep that kevin mitchell i never would have expected him in the qqq spot it ' s no accident that the first two names are qqq only as with first and second base qqq was the year of the glove average da was qqq points higher in both leagues than any other year looks good too bad he ' s moving to short highest five year regular though he ' s only had one year as good as kevin mitchell the other elite fielders in the league this is an interesting line his qqq figure was slightly below average his qqq was pathetic and his qqq was the next best year by anybody part of that may be his mobility qqq was with the yankees qqq was with the padres who appear to have a rotten infield qqq was with the twins and judging by leius and gaetti the metrodome may be a good place to play third add another to the elite fielders list too fielders whose career average may overstate their value i do n ' t know what happened to caminiti judging by the three previous years his low qqq may be a fluke sabo is merely average however his incredible qqq best year ever brings his average up a lot strange last two years according to reputation one of the best fielders ever at third base but at the end he was below average average in qqq was qqq boggs has been pretty good i do n ' t know what happened in qqq but every other year he has been above average usually by quite a bit last year a fluke or a portent why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another but very different from year to year any ideas brook is declining three first time regulars above average in qqq i ' m not sure why jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding he ' s never had a good year but while at second he improved to become an average fielder and is an average fielder at third zeile on the other hand is a below average fielder each year he ' s about qqq points below average and it ' s probably not just the park since terry pendleton had excellent das in the three years before this moving back to second was a good idea so why is hayes supposed to be good defensively he ' s had a grand total of one year above the league da and was pretty bad last year howard johnson and carney lansford separated at birth to his credit hojo did have one above average year qqq lansford could n ' t even break the qqq mark without the help of the year of the glove good hitter but his fielding needs work not a good fielder both are better off at shortstop two consecutive horrible years for leo camden yards does n ' t seem to have helped his fielding any texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career da but the lowest da at third ever congratulations dean dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu grad student at large

well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened but that ' s ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like plus minus make rbi look good ok how about a straigh answer then here ' s a very simele question to which i ' m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to please answer yes or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs al only please for anyone else following along it is a well known and demonstrable fact that a team ' s win loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows it ' s not a definite hard and fast function but there is definitely a correlation in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every qqq runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the qqq toronto blue jays we find that they scored qqq runs and allowed qqq of which morris allowed qqq all other things being equal if frank viola with his qqq era had replaced jack morris for the qqq innings morris threw plausible since viola threw qqq for boston the red jays would have allowed about qqq fewer runs or enough for qqq qqq more wins now that does n ' t take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a qqq if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate viola ' s as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off this is true but not so open that your brain falls out mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com
oops i came across this file from last year thought you might enjoy some of these thoughts the predictions were made on the date indicated they are largely out of order june qqq qqq tedward @ cs . cornell . edu me you all know how things turned out the orioles red sox and yankees all disappeared the jays and tigers continued at essentially the expected pace the brewers and indians cranked in the second half the rangers predictably took a dive that should n ' t have surprised anybody meanwhile as predicted the mariners dropped behind the angels and royals they clearly did n ' t deserve the qqq qqq record in june the white sox and a ' s upped their game a bit while the twins dropped off a little but for the most part things were as expected okay so there were a few blatant errors but for a predictive calculation i thought this did pretty well from cavgeoe @ yalevm . ycc . yale edu tue mar qqq qqq qqq hm pete smith made the rotation instead of mercker and bielecki was n ' t released until the end of the year i wo n ' t comment on the bullpen jeff reardon right on blauser wrong on bream and mitchell a bit early on lonnie as with bielecki did n ' t pick sanders did anybody three of them went right showalter is still around and likely to stick it seems from mattel . auto - trol . com ! mattel @ auto - trol . com tue mar qqq qqq qqq nope they won the division and so kept him for a shot at the playoffs well they did n ' t finish last got that one right nope i guess this is why you picked the mets to win huh tsk tsk not nice to predict something like this you got that right and my response okay so the mets finished fifth but i got the pirates and expos right first half dead on second half ummm i ' m a sox fan go easy on me so i got my predictions for gooden and saberhagen reversed i was at least close and was right about jefferies though i do n ' t know has wfan criticized the jefferies trade close no cigar some predictions need no introduction sometimes us statheads get lucky grace did n ' t hit behind dawson the entire season but he also finished with only qqq rbis nope he slowed down and the injury finished him off did n ' t even reach qqq but a ballsy prediction nonetheless from ecaxron @ mars . lerc . nasa . gov thu may qqq qqq qqq the orioles finished seven games out none of them won qqq though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right the rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre the yankees and indians led with qqq wins the red sox trailed with qqq wins none were horrible but four were five or more games below qqq from djohnson @ cayley . uwaterloo . ca david johnson date thu qqq aug qqq qqq gmt you win from king @ cogsci ucsd . edu thu nov qqq qqq qqq you were right from stvjas @ meteor . wisc . edu fri sep qqq qqq qqq he had qqq ip but did n ' t win the cy young maddux surprised all i do n ' t think i want to wait that long but they won qqq games last year and they were fifth in the league in era not a bad start looks like it he was n ' t bad last year just too consistent to be an ace so far this year looks like more of the same i honestly ca n ' t say did they get rid of him their bb totals were down last year i just do n ' t think he ' s that good so far so good i ' m definitely not waiting to check this one from qqq fri sep qqq qqq qqq current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief he has a rubber arm and unusual delivery he might be decent in that role from lyle @ ecn . purdue . edu sat sep qqq qqq qqq wrong on all of the above hal morris and my favorites from tedward sun oct qqq qqq qqq belle hit qqq hr last year walking qqq times but five of those were intentional okay so i exaggerate but i might have been right from trn @ strdev . jhuapl . edu tue mar qqq qqq qqq how much did cal sign for when did he sign if i remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season and finally from jpalmer @ uwovax . uwo . ca thu sep qqq qqq qqq snyder is still in sf acker is gone they are n ' t in the majors never heard of him i do n ' t think they are in the majors dunno what happened to him if he ' s still around he ' s stuck in the minors hm with raines out bo looks to get a lot of pt hm -
later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other people ' s mouths i would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one way namely that i along with greg claim that gainey never made a technical mistake if you actually read what i ' ve written you will find that i make no such claim soooo if logic serves me well you ' re contradicting yourself roger i ' m not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion but hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go ahead that ' s if it makes you feel better my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does he bother you so much he was an effective player for his style of play i ' m really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here why do n ' t you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison i ' m wrong again hmmm let ' s see where was i wrong in the first place i ' m only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that you ' ve setup a you ' re wrong again macro key on your machine i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic but i think you know what i ' m getting at i would also like to point out that gilmour ' s potential as a selke winner was never part of the debate are you asking me for an opinion if so i think there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour among the candidates i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game so yes settle down nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods c ' mon it has a nice ring to it and admit it you had a good laugh congenially as always jd james david david @ student . business . uwo . ca

could someone post the flyers record with and without eric lindros in the lineup i have a guy that is trying to compare the quebec flyers trade to the dallas minnesota trade in the nfl ( hershel walker i just need the stat to back up my point that eric will be one of the next great players thanks
sorry i still do n ' t buy it you ' re certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with the play but the argument here is over what constitutes interference you certainly can not infer from what you ' ve quoted that the batter runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you have n ' t posted a definition of interference at all imo this calls for one of the approved ruling [ s that go in small print in the rulebook something like approved ruling if in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the defensive team ' s making a play on him the batter runner shall be judeged guilty of interference or approved ruling the runner can not be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor rules trivia question since it can not be authoritatively answered .
it depends if in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit the batter is awarded first for a base on balls if the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way he ' s awarded first because of a hit batsman ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine
unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate players dave winfield has had a better career than half the people in the hall of fame eddie murray and darrel evans are both one of the top qqq players of all time lee smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since qqq with the possible exception of gossage on the other hand kingman probably is n ' t one of the best qqq players of all time and reardon though a good pitcher is n ' t in smith ' s class career wise we ' re talking qqq of the top qqq players of all time here there probably are n ' t qqq shortstops in history who were better than these two garvey sucked morris while a very good pitcher simply does n ' t belong near cooperstown gee can these guys even compare to if puckett and ryan okay no if there get into to the hall they will be marginal hall of famers unless puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer to put this in perspective here ' s a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention in parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it while no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give you a good value of these guys careers as compared to average players robin yount qqq qqq ozzie smith qqq qqq dave winfield qqq qqq eddie murray qqq qqq darrel evans qqq qqq kirby puckett qqq qqq nolan ryan qqq qqq jack morris qqq qqq dave kingman qqq steve garvey qqq to give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the hall of the qqq eligible players whose career stats equaled qqq qqq are in the hall of fame the ones who are n ' t include qqq qqq century players ron santo bobby grich and bob johnson of those eligible who score between qqq and qqq qqq of qqq are in of those eligible who score between qqq and qqq qqq of qqq are in .
norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team when he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again he gave the impression that he was willing to do so he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only qqq fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged qqq fans despite increasd ticket prices i think the team ' s attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc oh well i guess the bottom line is green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas and was n ' t willing to wait another year or so in mn dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesota ' s was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down there as well all this means is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two too bad for the nhl .
heh try the rec . autos . sport faq they are always calling espn to complain i ' m sure you could find the number for abc there too as many west coast viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into the long beach gp were you and several of the other people here it seems asleep the day contracts were explained aspn has a piece of paper saying it must show that baseball game if it happens many businesses payedd money to have their commercials run during a baseball game this is a business not your own personal video servant maybe you should put that anger into something positive for example i saw ads for the new dodge both on the espn and kbl broadcasts why not write to dodge saying that thanks to the ads run during the stanley cup playoffs you will now concider their products in the future they love to hear stuff like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time for hockey games giving espn and other networks more incentive to carry games just one example come on people as great as we think it is hockey does not leapfrog the big three overight .

well my question still has n ' t been answered if spanky was bad enough to release this year why did he get so much playing time last year yes i know he was part of a platoon and that ' s why he got more playing time than slaught but that does n ' t answer the question if slaught was so obviously better this year was n ' t this also obvious last year and should n ' t he have been taking away some of spanky ' s playing time against righties ?
how do you know they can be shortened by half an hour has anybody done a study to determine how much time is actually wasted say in these a ' s games ?
i forgot to mention that the stats are for games through qqq .
by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at qqq thursday night the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of qqq rose as one to rock the old barn at qqq oakland avenue in a salute to the playoff bound blues the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit red wings qqq stars qqq with the north stars loss the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division good thing because the blues quit playing they held a qqq qqq lead over tampa bay when the detroit minnesota final appeared with qqq minutes qqq remaining in the second period they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a qqq qqq victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer tampa ' s bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers but officiating supervisor john d ' amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired i ' m glad i did n ' t see it go in at the end blues coach bob berry said if the goal had counted he ' d have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final qqq minutes holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berry ' s anger it was n ' t pretty at the end he said we played qqq qqq great minutes as good as we played all year it slipped away at the end it should n ' t have but it did still the blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at game ' s end despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the blues still made the playoffs they ' ll meet the chicago blackhawks in a best of seven norris division semifinal beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium the blues finished the regular season with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points their fourth consecutive qqq season minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points tampa bay which played spoiler last week by tying the blues qqq qqq at tampa ended its first season with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment it ' s a shame we let down said kevin miller one of three blues to score two goals brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others there was no need for a letdown if we ' d have kept working it would have ended qqq qqq and everyone would be happy instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and that ' s all that matters said brett hull scoreless and qqq for the night once we got up qqq qqq it was really tough to play some players did n ' t have a problem just because the score was announced our line did n ' t quit said rich sutter who played with bassen and miller we still had a game to play you ca n ' t allow five goals like we did that ' s not right it was disappointing to see what was going on bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesota ' s loss i did n ' t know it was final he said i was kind of looking around on the bench i did n ' t realize it was a final for some reason we ' re in the playoffs and that ' s great but it ' s a little disappointing to play like we did at the end the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board the score showed qqq qqq until it first popped up with detroit leading qqq qqq in the third period the blues already led qqq qqq at the time i told them i did n ' t want to see the score i did n ' t want to know the score berry said i felt we had to win the game and that ' s the approach we took if minnesota took a lead berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowd going at qqq of the first period scoring his qqq of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with qqq seconds remaining in the period then just qqq seconds later bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone bassen made it qqq qqq just qqq seconds into the second period scoring on the rebound of bret hedican ' s shot the goal gave him his first two goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age qqq on feb qqq i was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said he ' s in heaven now and i know he was watching i know he ' s happy miller increased the blues lead to qqq qqq on a break away goal set up by zombo at qqq then steve maltais broke curtis joseph ' s shutout just qqq seconds later making it qqq qqq less than a minute after the north stars final was announced tim bergland scored and cut the lead to qqq qqq but shanahan scored his qqq converting a pass from nelson emerson with qqq seconds remaining in the second period then it was all lightning adam creighton scored qqq seconds into the third period prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of qqq midway through the third period the goals by chambers and cole made shanahan ' s second goal stand up as the winner we were in there shanahan said the game was over we were in "
in response to a debate about who has has a better season jagr of francis i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats do n ' t exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better is a useful statistic if a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right it is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar ratings if they are equally good players it can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics but how useful are the ones that you suggest total ice time would be very useful it is a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless it would be a better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones a very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who does n ' t recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player this stat would be much more flawed than and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent is a useful stat it is quite useful in evaluating player talent you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such .
i believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died uh he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car and smashing it into a tree as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car and the speeding reported was over qqq mph reckless driving actually i had n ' t heard about this thanks i do n ' t know what you were reading or watching but i sure saw a lot about that and about dykstra ' s poker games most of the writing was along the lines of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was and how he ' d hurt the team by wracking himself and the catcher up etc espn raised questions about his judgement etc the print media here in the sf area questioned why disciplinary action would n ' t be taken against dykstra and one article pointed out that if lenny wanted to kill himself there were ways that would n ' t endanger other people ' s lives then there was dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it was etc mike

let ' s fill in some winners here :
all of this is fine i never said that murray was a bad gm i merely said that he is n ' t the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup by now probably more than once if he was as great a gm as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success but murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this is true anyway .
another pair of suggestions qqq remove the balk rule it is the runners responsibility to stay safe no matter what the pitcher does qqq if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x qqq to qqq without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base as if walked this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably suppose the pitcher uses up qqq of his n pick off attempts the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time would this suggestion apply to pick off attempts per pitch per batter or per base runner on the same base dr edward j baranoski mit lincoln laboratory it ' s got to be the going rm qqq po box qqq not the getting there that ' s good lexington ma qqq - harry chapin from greyhound qqq qqq

most of the points you made about lopez v berryhill olson have been made by others and realizing that lopez must be the second coming of frank thomas i have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters see this is essentially what everyone was doing comparing lopez to one of the best players in the game i ' m really looking forward to seeing this can ' t miss superstar now as for thomas i remember being an advocate of his being brought up in qqq even though he was only qqq or qqq ca n ' t remember but who did the sox have at first calderon martinez kittle the spot was there the talent was there sure i say go for it i am not convinced that lopez is anywhere near as talented as thomas was after his aa season in qqq and i am not convinced that olson berryhill are nearly as bad as kittle martinez were btw i do n ' t think thomas was hurt by those three months well if we ca n ' t compare our guy to one of the best in the game let ' s compare our decision to one of the most boneshead right cal eldred was qqq when he came up with a full season at aaa and a longer minor league career frankly i do n ' t know why he did n ' t make the club in qqq bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history and just watching him makes me think that i missed a career as a big league pitcher no one i repeat no one laughed louder than i did at the sheffield trade though i guess mieske has a future i take it back mcilvaine may have laughed louder aw gee shucks thanks guy except i missed the part where sdcn ' s admit they ' re wrong the beastmaster

unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you ca n ' t fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref is n ' t looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i do n ' t like it but that ' s the way the league is going .

the orioles pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season four shutouts low team era well i have n ' t gotten any baseball news since march qqq but anyways could they contend yes could they win it all maybe but for all those fans of teams with bad spring records remember earl weaver ' s first law of baseball from his book on managing no one gives a damn in july if you lost a game in march btw anyone have any idea on the contenders for the o ' s fifth starter it ' s pretty much set that sutcliffe mussina mcdonald and rhodes are the first four in the rotation .
with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks much to my delight i noticed their qqq game playoff losing streak qqq to the pens last year and now qqq to the blues and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive losses is if there even is one i ' m pretty sure that the hawks have at least a qqq game losing streak since they ' ve had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that was basically i need something else to rag on my hawks fan friend with mike the insomniaced
question if a team uses qqq players in a season do you merely divide the total by qqq if so a player who plays in only qqq game is considered equally valuable as a player who plays in all of them since the standard deviation for each team is different i am unsure how transferable between teams that these stats are should n ' t the average standard deviation in the league be used i am interested in seeing each method but i still think that mine is the best if for no other reason than familiarity .
there ' s a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid i thought i ' d put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant i splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars the highest paid player is frank thomas at qqq i cut some players like kenny lofton chris hoiles keith mitchell tim wakefield and a bunch of pitchers all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of qqq million for the lot of them the total team salary is qqq averaging slightly over qqq k a player if that ' s too steep you can dump thomas and bagwell replacing them with paul sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars and still have one of the best teams in the majors p juan guzman qqq p mussina qqq p castillo qqq p eldred qqq p rhodes qqq p militello qqq rp rojas qqq rp beck qqq rp melendez qqq rp hernandez qqq rp nied qqq c rodriguez qqq c piazza qqq qqq thomas qqq qqq bagwell qqq qqq knoblauch qqq qqq barberie qqq qqq gomez qqq qqq palmer qqq ss listach qqq ss pena qqq lf gonzalez qqq cf lankford qqq rf r . sanders qqq of plantier qqq

well it really is n ' t this cut and dry but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they ' d throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience granted witt might be good but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff the orioles should also be there in the end .
you started it you most certainly did sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i ' d call that predicting the future right i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance and in this case everything else pointed to sabo that comes down to the same thing when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you do n ' t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i ' d say this is insulting right this is the beef it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances at least none that we ' ve been able to come up with if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret most certainly as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably well it was a stupid argument are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo did n ' t get a hit we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not one ab most certainly does n ' t prove anything is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall if you mean the first then as you say we ' ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggests a rule we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years i think you will agree that if the rule did n ' t work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year right i ' m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from qqq and then hit poorly in qqq as well you can also find those who hit poorly from qqq and then hit well in qqq gambler ' s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ' ve seen a detailed study of why i should n ' t expect it to correlate the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid and i do n ' t see how you can deny it as for total idiot yes if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind ?
a hbp but it reminds of my favorite apochryphal sp don drysdale story when ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot dogged on him in two previous at bats drysdale reared back with the first pitch and drilled him right in the ribs his manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled what did you do that for drysdale growled back what are you complaining for i saved you three pitches incidentally if this is true i ' d love to know the other people involved ted kury one man stands and the wall cracks and the wall suny at buffalo cracks and the wall cracks and the wall comes dept of economics crumbling down anthrax
i am an ulf and pgh fan and what pisses me off about the whole adam graves ulf samuesson debate is that ulf plays hard hitting hockey nothing wrong with that while graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to intentionally hurt someone which bites i thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap like that is it just me or does the officiating just still stink to high heaven imho if they could get rid of the existing refs and institute a new system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble makers then a lot of these things would stop and then the game would be ruled by the finnesse players mario selanne bure messier et . al .
whatever you say i think it ' s just qqq games into the season myself so i ' m going to wait a bit before calling names i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him on the other hand i expect him to release otto if he does n ' t turn things around pretty fast btw otto ' s game score for that qqq ip stinker was only qqq which points out a problem with the method since otto ' s performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly prolonged i think merced ' s rookie year was a bit flukey but are n ' t you willing to give him some more at bats and tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy no he did n ' t walk is a time bomb he has no stuff whatsoever and when the league finally realizes this it wo n ' t be pretty at all do n ' t be so fast doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors meanwhile i ' m not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a six year free agent before the qqq season twice through the rotation and you ' ve given up yikes but so has his age at least in baseball terms the useful half life of a qqq year old injury prone catcher ca n ' t be much longer than a year but he wanted to be a dodger and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous qqq i do n ' t think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him he certainly was n ' t last year hey that ' s the skates smith package deal anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or base running particularly at this stage is a real weirdo if that ' s the goal of the team ownership than i do n ' t see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy i do n ' t know what he has or has n ' t said about revenue sharing so i ca n ' t comment there it ' s annoying but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king it was probably unavoidable meanwhile i think bigger accomplishments of simmons tenure were getting some value for john smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year drafting well in qqq letting the rookies show something in qqq foley smith and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts which means that even if fail it has n ' t done serious damage to the bucs future does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case i never heard the outcome of this when will the final verdict be in on this i ' m not sure who was the idiot in this case so i do n ' t know who to blame it might have been doug danforth after all in fact i seriously suspect it was doug danforth who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet btw i ' ve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site so if somebody known to impersonate e . e cummings can see this would he drop me a short note )

i would argue gerald that bowman is the first modern coach bowman ' s canadiens were the first nhl team to have a weight room in the qqq he is the first coach i have seen that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours during important games listen to the pre game interview will bowman and compare that to what is on the ice i agree bowman is a master of the lineups remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free in ot when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach i am left asking what is a modern coach if not bowman "

well i ' m a wings fan and i think the first thing that you should do is to get the opponent ' s line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone with them there is no yzerman fedorov probert line except for maybe on a powerplay these three players usually play on three different lines which would mean that toronto ' s checking line would have to pull a triple shift the wings lines usually look like this gallant yzerman ciccarelli kozlov fedorov drake kennedy burr probert ysebaert primeau sheppard oh by the way start praying )

i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view i do n ' t like to see stickwork but you have to clear players away from in front my personal favorite move i ' m a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref is n ' t looking makes ' em go down like a ton of bricks but does n ' t cause injuries unless they do n ' t know how to fall i ' m talking about hitting the blades here not the foot it also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time i do n ' t do this if a shot is likely on the short side hmm maybe i should mail potvin this method in french and with helpful diagrams of course it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli who i have a great deal of respect for btw he ' s not a big guy but he plays huge fall on his back a few times )
this comes up periodically and i just do n ' t get it take for example mark mcgwire he walked qqq times in qqq if that ' s not a potential great example of what you ' re talking about then i do n ' t know what is now let ' s look at what happens when mcgwire does n ' t walk qqq of the time he made an out qqq of the time he hit a single qqq of the time he hit a double qqq of the time he hit a homer now you ' re pitching against mcgwire would you trade qqq walks for qqq homers qqq double qqq singles and qqq outs i would why give him the base when you can get him out qqq times out of qqq then there are guys like alex cole who has a career qqq obp even though he ' s never had a batting average over qqq he did hit qqq in qqq ab in qqq or hit a single home run yep that ' s right he ' s never hit a homer in qqq ab ' s through the end of qqq who ' d be afraid to throw a strike to him mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com
you ' re definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between clark and bonds he must and i mean must get fastballs to hit otherwise he becomes little more than sixto lezcano in disguise what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds williams and clark qqq qqq qqq the reason being that i feel bonds potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he ' s stuck behind two slow runners i think the chance of getting qqq qqq extra stolen bases with bonds in the qqq spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having clark in the qqq spot .

i ' ve been following the giants closely over the off season newspapers notesgroup etc but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick after watching giants hitters struggle last year barry ' s swing was very impressive he ' s very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well i ' m not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits qqq qqq hr for qqq rbi ' s the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better clayton ' s defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year manwaring is driving the ball so on so forth i hope it continues i think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for real particularly the pitching for myself i think the fresh start of magowan baker etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year .
when i left it was qqq qqq blues with qqq to go as i predicted in i was right in the first place blues in qqq yes of course it ' s only one game that could be the hawks stab in the face to wake them up that ' s what playoffs are about on any given day )
actually what i think has become more evident is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all cost jagr did not have a better season than francis to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i . e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team ' s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications brad brad k gibson internet gibson @ geop . ubc . ca dept of geophysics astronomy qqq qqq main mall phone qqq qqq university of british columbia fax qqq qqq vancouver british columbia canada qqq t qqq

okay here ' s some gripe " ing griping whatever i live in santa barbara for reference i think okay abc showed the kings flames fine yawn espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the red wings toronto game cool but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that espn would show pitt nj on tuesday and bos buff on thursday i raced home from work early qqq pacific to catch the game but alas it was the boston buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the pitt nj game on thursday overnight they changed their mind i did n ' t mind that much i watched the game hockey is much better than no hockey during the game their were no video highlights from the patrick division what the hell was going on at least they should show video highlights of the other games especially the nyi caps game that was so close my father lives in bowling green kentucky bumbf * ck egypt got to watch the pens game on espn i just do n ' t get it the biggest problem is that buffalo or boston fans who did n ' t want to see the pittsburgh new jersey game qqq will turn on their tvs on thursday and see the pittsburgh new jersey game qqq instead of the buffalo boston game qqq at least in my case i just had to wait qqq more days to see my game if i were a big boston or buffalo fan and i missed the game on tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn i ' d be mad as hell oh well hopefully we ' ll get better coverage next year or something matt coohill

why dc baltimore is one of the top media markets the only thing the nhl seems to care about these days they ' ve been doing far better than the nba bullets at the gate for the last five years the team has been a perennial contender and fan support has been good to excellent why should pollin move to city that ' s five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro sports i do n ' t get it .
wood is fairly small for an enforcer type i mean fleury does a pretty good job and is n ' t that large but dody is no fleury having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply is n ' t ready to fight at an nhl level assuming that it ' s his role which is all he really showed us in his few games up from k . c if he can pass shoot or skate i never saw much of it all he has is a right fist which is n ' t bad but at the nhl level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant once you control that hand he ' s a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him his entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening and i never once saw him find an opening worth talking about he got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times unless he shows some new tricks in camp he ' ll be on my career minor leaguer list since this was his first taste of the nhl i expect the sharks gave it to him so he ' d know what he ' d have to work on off season he needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond because he was n ' t particularly good as a goon .

actually this part was really interesting it turns out that the mask is custom fit to the goalie ' s face the goalie puts his her face through a piece of wood or was it plastic with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic wrap type material and vaseline is put on the goaltender ' s face then a plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about qqq minutes to dry sufficiently when it dries it is effectively a mold of the goalie ' s face this is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage etc etc john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show yeah essensa ' s mask looked really good actually i thought i heard him say that it _ was _ potvin ' s for certain i would bet money on it either way and it did look awesome !
well here it is nhl in the year qqq i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun you can see the league has already started to move to this direction the walt disney conference anaheim mighty chipmunks - franchise name to be changed after each new la kings hockey movie la flames - we ' ve seen some of that san jose sharks san diego bruins tijuana red wings - detroit ' s hockey team will follow its car industry dallas stars houston oilers texas rangers seattle canucks the norm green conference alabama white hawks biloxi blues tampa bay lightning miami blades helsinki jets - you ' ve heard them starting getting used to the anthem montreal quebecois sp - there will be no canada atlanta devils orlando penquins key west islanders hartford whalers the whalers will never move huh palm beach capitals now that the anahaim team is becomming real i ' m really beginning to believe the rest of the message i ' m sure the future will turn you into believers too after qqq the nhl will abandond ice rinks it ' s so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway nhl will become a roller skating hockey league that way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards !
not boring is right it is more likely to cause me to have a stroke i had to listen to game two on the blackhawk station and i do n ' t think i could take another call of and joseph makes a spectacular saaaaaave now i ' m a blues fan but i do n ' t want them to play like they played in game two sure the result was fine but the blues match up very well with the hawks so they really do n ' t need to treat them like the qqq flames we do n ' t need a monday night miracle to have a chance to beat chicago the blues can do it on talent at least over the hawks rich h go blues !

i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps biggest surprises and biggest disappointments this year now these are just my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an opportunity to see all the teams the same amount anyway mvp most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and in terms of leadership ca n ' t win without him biggest surprise the player who rose above expectation the player that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even if that new level does n ' t necessarily warrant an allstar berth includes those players who at the outset of the season may not even have been in the team ' s plans biggest disappointment the player from whom we expected more e . g i picked denis savard in montreal because with the new emphasis on offence brought by demers should n ' t savard have done better team biggest biggest team mvp surprise disappointment boston bruins oates d . sweeney wesley buffalo sabres lafontaine mogilny audette jinx calgary flames roberts reichel petit chicago blackhawks roenick ruuttu goulet detroit red wings yzerman chaisson kozlov edmonton oilers manson buchberger mellanby hartford whalers sanderson cassells corriveau los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey minnesota north stars modano tinordi ( not expected back broten montreal canadiens muller lebeau savard new jersey devils stevens semak maclean new york islanders turgeon king ( finally marois new york rangers messier kovalev bourque ottawa senators maciver baker jelinek philadelphia flyers lindros recchi fedyk galley eklund pittsburgh penguins lemieux tocchet ( even for him jagr quebec nordiques sakic ricci kovalenko pearson san jose sharks kisio gaudreau maley st louis blues shanahan c . joseph ron sutter tampa bay lightening bradley bradley creighton kasper toronto maple leafs gilmour potvin ellett anderson vancouver canucks bure nedved ( finally momesso washington capitals hatcher bondra cote elynuik winnipeg jets selanne selanne druce as i mentioned up top these are my impressions from where i sit i would welcome any opinions from those fans nearer their teams in other words anywhere away from a toronto newspaper )

until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football last year i hardly watched a game what turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game a team scores qqq minutes of commercials kickoff qqq minutes of commercials three downs and a punt qqq minutes of commercials aaaaarrrrgh earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a ' s whom i believe institutionalize slow play i do n ' t mind the cat and mouse game with rickey on first in fact i rather enjoy it similarly i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonia on first what i object to is when such games are played with karkovice on first or when the game is a blowout i do n ' t mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration what i object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity when a game is exciting these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game when the delays happen with regularity they become nuisances just like the commercial breaks in football i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up the games basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster that did not address the problem of the continuity of the game it may have appeased the sponsors and the networks but i would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans similary while some qqq baseball games bore me to tears those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch i doubt if anyone watching the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out i doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present i would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball on the other hand i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do i sure would n ' t mind a little arm twisting there the beastmaster
unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you ca n ' t fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref is n ' t looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i do n ' t like it but that ' s the way the league is going by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin devil game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that are there any ex nhl hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion ?

what about including points probably no goals at least against opponents but there have been several assists given .
well i think whenever espn covers the game they do a wonderful job but what i do n ' t understand is that they cut the ot just show some stupid baseball news which is not important at all then i waited for the scores to comeon sportscenter but they talk about baseball basketball and football then they showed penguine highlight and went back to stupid basketball finally they showed a highlight of the ot goal but that was like qqq sec i think they should give more attention to nhl during the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games i guess it is nhl ' s fault too for leaving espn hope things improve by next season cobra -
st as for more captain trivia the next edmonton st catain was lee fogilin who was later traded to st the buffalo sabres after him was wayne gretzky st who w traded to l a then came kevin low who st nly this year was traded to the n y rangers was n ' t mark messier captain of the oilers before kevin lowe but of course he was traded as well so your point of every oilers captain being traded is still true .
about as good as mussina ' s better than sutcliffe ' s and mcdonald ' s he ' s in the bullpen steinbrenner is in charge after all he ' s got the talent to be the qqq starter now and evetually the ace he was a higher ranked and generally better prospect than arthur rhodes who happens to be well hey the oriole ' s qqq starter as for militello it ' s still early .
well there were qqq outs in a row with no hits or walks in between but really he only retired qqq batters in a row the first out of the game was the front end of a double play still counts as a back end perfect game in my book though congrats to chris bosio too bad the brewers could n ' t hold on to him .
you know what frank it ' s not david poile ' s fault that the caps have mired in mediocrity for so long blame it on the owner abe polin this guy owns both the nba ' s bullets and the nhl ' s capitals how dumb and selfish could this guy be he ' s unwilling to spend the bucks in order to get a big star to landover no wonder both teams stink i ' ve heard that the capitals had a chance to get detroit ' s steve yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute why because our good man abe is afraid to spend the cash nevertheless i ' m still faithful and hoping that one day this devilish dictator will be replaced .
but maybe his wife was i do n ' t claim to know whether it ' s true or not but a couple different people totally unrelated have said harry was relieved of his duties because he had more than platonic relations with augie busch ' s wife judgement is left to the individual cuz i sure do n ' t claim to be an impeachable source in this case .

actually i was simply relaying the reasoning of this so called genius bw writer i agree the reasoning was foolish next time before you say something foolish be aware what you are responding to .
i think you missed one of my points there it takes more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine but the point of my original original post if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not the coaching abilities which leads to below i think at this point there ' s a personal emotional element involved here which transcends murray ' s logical thought as outsiders it ' s fine for us to say he should hire a different coach in fact he has talked about doing so in the past but the press here in detroit at least has so built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second round he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhaps but we ' re all a little that way from time to time i think eventually he ' ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will improve as a result i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work in that sense once he steps down as coach we ' ll see how good of a gm he really is i may not agree with everything you ' ve said but it ' s been fun discussing it with you .
the original poster wanted to know how the big cat looked i was also at the saturday game in montreal apr qqq that rockies won qqq qqq i have n ' t paid much attention to gallarraga since he left the expos but his stance seemed to be much different he stands more erect and very open with his left foot pointing to qqq base i ' m wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter he could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away if this is indeed a new stance for him maybe he is not being fooled as easily as for his patience dennis martinez definitely did not have his good stuff if he was grooving pitches to andres you can hardly fault him for drilling them which he did does andres generally start hot or cold does it take until may for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away ?
i too think that joseph has had a great year and should be considered for the vezina i think barrasso and joseph should be the two strongest candidates this year i do n ' t believe all of the hype that roy belfour and now potvin receive for their goaltending i do think that they are great in the nets but i would rather have curtis tommy or fuhr in the nets during this years playoffs the big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front of them and the goaltenders get the most credit i would rather face qqq shots a game than have to rely on joseph saving qqq but if the goalie is going to face qqq shots i would rather have joseph or barrasso facing them - jay ps go quebec and i know that mclean and several others should be mentioned as candidates for this years vezina but i am partial to joseph and barrasso this season .
i ' m the tickets grrrr let ' s start a whole nother topic on show bad the sharks are doing on these things i swear that all of my partial plan games were televised i know i ' m exaggerating but in order - the new ticket prices suck - wait till people try to park at games next year public transit yeah right i ' d love to take caltrain for qqq hours to see a qqq hour game shelling out hundreds of dollars for partial season plans for two years does nt mean anything to the sharks as i get to pick my seats after the dead rise from their graves to claim their seats - frank
i made a mistake on the posted article been fighting food poisoning for last qqq hours the second paragraph should state the following doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand sorry for the error did n ' t know it until after posting .
there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs whereas soon after they went to the divisional set up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the bruins play the captials in the first round maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but i prefer the divisional playoff .
i was in fact going to suggest that roger take his way of discussion over to r . s . football . pro there this kind of hormone only reasoning is the standard being he canadian and hockey what it is i would have suggested that r . s . h would work too it is important in a thread that everyone involved use the same body part to produce a post brain being the organ of choice here .

ah so now we ' re into european player bashing what next no more french canadiens yeah there ' s an idea let them french speaking canadiens have their own hockey league we do n ' t want them are you _ crazy _ the nhl is one of the true international leagues and yes there _ are _ many europeans who deserve to play in the nhl and are better than some north americans look at teemu i for one am glad to see europeans in the nhl and i hope the nhl soon expands to europe its nice to see all these different people come together to form the soon to be qqq hockey teams darryl brooks university at buffalo _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \ ___ / __ \ ______ _ _ _ _ _ _ /

tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year ' s defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run value of defensive performances compared to league average i ' ve combined those with my position adjusted mlv numbers to come up with first approximation total run values for players last year we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award major caveats these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield that will cause some inaccuracies the offensive numbers are position adjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair finally we still do n ' t know what to do about catchers and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of tony phillips and bip roberts having said that there are still some surprises let ' s look national league first all numbers in total runs contributed over the season player offense defense total sandberg qqq qqq qqq bonds qqq qqq qqq walker qqq qqq qqq justice qqq qqq qqq daulton qqq qqq larkin qqq qqq qqq grace qqq qqq qqq as i see it these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season if you deflate sandberg ' s offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat had bonds been his usual defensive self it would n ' t have been close but that apparently was n ' t the case darren daulton needs qqq or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference and i could n ' t tell you whether that ' s easy or impossible a good case could be made for any of sandberg bonds or daulton as top dude my personal vote bonds sandberg daulton walker justice in the american league player offense defense total ventura qqq qqq qqq martinez qqq qqq qqq b anderson qqq qqq qqq thomas qqq qqq qqq r henderson qqq qqq qqq raines qqq qqq qqq tettleton qqq qqq ok let ' s see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year i certainly did n ' t but i ' d have a hard time arguing against him at this point yes i know these numbers are only approximate but that ' s a big gap between him and the qqq guy also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds once again there ' s a catcher in the ointment if calling a game is as important as it might be qqq runs is easy to make up or give away take a guess folks i do n ' t think we can do any better than that my personal vote excluding pitchers ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson i ' m a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive defensive contribution which should have a higher leverage in w l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense for the record carlos baerga qqq qqq qqq roberto alomar qqq qqq qqq forget it it ' s a wash let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattingly ' s defense this past season don recovered brilliantly from his weak qqq and qqq to end up with mattingly qqq qqq qqq runs which is clearly an above average first baseman however it ' s still qqq runs behind mark mcgwire qqq runs behind frank thomas and qqq runs behind john olerud on the other hand it ' s ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned .
well maybe it will be banks is a qqq year old prospect who has n ' t matured as quickly as they would have liked mahomes is a qqq year old who is very highly touted tapani and erickson are also young and have looked very good this spring the last spot was between jim deshaies formerly of houston and s . d and mike trombley deshaies has n ' t looked very good this spring so i believe that the spot has gone to trombley although they had n ' t wanted qqq starters this unproven i personally believe very highly in mahomes and trombley well scott leius is the shortstop he played mostly qqq last year but was a ss in the minors and moved back after gagne left to k . c qqq is split maybe between pagliarulo who has had a great spring and terry jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in portland for qqq years i ' m not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be happy with what they have here i like jorgenson but i fear they might give too much time to pags sorry ca n ' t help you here .
oh to be back in the good old days when i lived in florida florida for petes sake and could watch hockey every night as espn and usa alternated coverage nights oh well i guess it would be too simple for the home office to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present of course i should n ' t complain at least i ' m getting to watch the playoffs for a change hooray now if the espn schedulers will realise there are other teams except pittsberg in the patrick sounds like a dr suess book koz
not what kind of happy grass you are smoking maybe you should share some with me first of all lou gehrig is the greatest first baseman ever jimmie foxx is clearly the next best first baseman ever he could be the greatest first baseman of the yankees in the modern era to put him in this best in the history of baseball is quite humorous very silly and totally off the line .
well here in detroit we get to see and hear don cherry quite regularly the detroit area picks up hockey night in canada from cbc ch qqq in windsor where we see don cherry ' s coaches corner between periods we also get to see don cherry ' s grapevine just before the game the grapevine is a hockey talk show where don talks to a player or coach about what else hockey it ' s actually a pretty good show and don is n ' t as annoying as he is on coaches corner i think this is were don got his nickname grapes but i ' m not sure don use to coach the boston bruins i do n ' t know exactly when that was could someone fill me in on this info a local radio station here in detroit wllz talks to don every tuesday morning personally i ' ve had my fill of donny he really pisses me off sometimes during the detroit toronto game monday night on cbc don gave high praise to doug gilmour saying he was a two way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that that ' s fine and i agree that gilmour is a good two way player but he said the exact same thing about yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show what gives it seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city don cherry i think insert star player name for city that he is in is the best two way player in the league today there have been other times ca n ' t remember exactly what he said that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to someone here on the net said something about how don criticized mario lemieux but when the time comes for don to broadcast the cup playoffs from the civic center yes i think the pens will make it out of the wales conference don will apologize left and right for his remarks about lemieux in my opinion he is an ass and i wo n ' t change my opinion if i ' m in a different city sorry if this did n ' t answer your question better but i just had to get this off my chest .
it is no matter what you call the teams jokerit and tps or helsinki tornado and turku typhoon the best palyers in finland would eventually end up in those teams anyway if they were in the big league .
bring back harry neale at least he was witty .
i would assume that the words i saw the picture indicated that those seats will not be available for baseball games if you look at the picture of the diamond in the stadium in relation to the areas marked not for baseball those seats just look terrible for watching baseball now if they should happen to reach the post season i would imagine that they would consider opening some of those seats up but that is surely a worry of the future sam lubchansky qqq in the champion people see what they ' d like to be in the loser they see what they actually are and they treat him with scorn "
while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart it is far from a no brainer the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best player in the league so your above arguement is really worthless the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team the leafs without gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the qqq pick like i said mario deserves it imho but it is a very close race and a gilmour victory would not surprise me i dislike doug gilmour with a passion but i must concede that he is extremely valuable to the leafs .
did you watch the games ?
they tried their best not to show it believe me i ' m surprised they could n ' t find a sprint car race mini cars through pigpens indeed on short notice george
as long as the yankees are in the same division the red sox will play better than qqq baseball or the red sox can hire former east german swimming coaches to train them at the fine art of body building the red sox can use chinese women swimmers as a reference with the hawk the red sox definitely have a chance for the east this year he brings class work ethic and leadership to the park each day and he has a burning desire to play in the world series future hall of famer andre dawson will kick butt in boston from rockies country ,
i watched the final inning of bosio ' s no hitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he would n ' t have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand in this morning ' s paper or was it on the radio vizquel was quoted as saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still easily thrown out riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the final play more memorable seems a litle cocky to me but he made it work so he ' s entitled i guess so still that ' s kind of a stupid move imo he ' d be singing a different tune if he had booted it and the next guy up had hit a bloop single stranger things have happened hey i used to be a big dave stieb fan and unfortunately there ' s no such thing as an unearned hit cheers ,
well in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game i was especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he could be a key to success for them this year defensively they really had a strong game hardly heard selanne ' s name all night craven also played one of his best games since coming over with a few exceptions they really did n ' t let the high flying jets do much high flying i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the canucks forwards they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series in short it was a great start !
implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne on the ice can be blamed on him roger he is a forward winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway let ' s put it another way john cullen ' s is terrible what ' s your excuse for him that his powerplay points do n ' t count neither do selanne ' s knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning you ' re worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team what he does best is score so i refer you to my comment above .
well if things were different and i had my way the headline would be nhl european division regular season game stockholm storm vs helsinki tornado qqq qqq two games against every north american based team qqq in all and this might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between helsinki and stockholm the remaining qqq games would involve paris dortmund milan a nice dream marcu $
if it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead it would probably also result ina greater number of pickoffs i think it would be a workable rule but it would probably be best to experiment in another league before trying it in the bigs .
after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible i ' ve really noticed an increase in tom barasso ' s cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders i ' ve also noticed that he usually gets away with it just as examples last night i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens scott and tocchet qqq minute minors he also kicked john mclean of course he was n ' t called for that is n ' t kicking an automatic match penalty and qqq game suspension i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest there ' s no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall he ' s also very good how about that tocchet head butt is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a non kicking match penalty i ca n ' t remember anymore .
it took three days to get to us but i ' ll try anyway as i naturally have n ' t seen the answer safe the correct call is infield fly batter out if fair runners may advance at own risk got ta tag up if caught etc it is not a force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the ss tags qqq or qqq it was n ' t clear above he has n ' t got the runner out out see rule qqq approved ruling below in this case the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule does n ' t apply sounds like a bad call here but that ' s not the point the batter is not out so a force situation is created therefore the runner is out unless by rule qqq the ball is dead and the batter is safe then i guess the runners would advance unmolested i ca n ' t really tell from qqq that the ball is dead in this situation pertinent rules qqq definition of infield fly when an infield fly is called runners may advance at their own risk if on an infield fly rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains in play despite the provisions of rule qqq the infield fly rule takes precedence qqq a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid or first second and third base occupied before two are out the ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases approved ruling in this situation the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground except when the infield fly rule applies .

pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office in northlands and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses that he did this was a good thing it is better he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars which would truly jeopardize the franchise pocklington ' s first option is not to sell or to move but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal either in northlands or via a new building pocklington probably is n ' t going to get exactly what he wants but ultimately he will probably get enough or will sell to someone who will probably get enough there are a lot of risks in moving a team also one has to remember peter puck ' s principle it is better to spend other people ' s money than one ' s own if at all possible .
it seemed pretty conclusive to me the puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line and the announcers admittedly homers kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs because it was obvious to them and i would have thought to anyone who saw the replay that the puck did n ' t go in the referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored this to me is unheard of seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the leaf chances this year cordially as always rm

this is very sad indeed my condolences to the minnesota fans who are losing their team i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in pittsburgh will be the steelers we should always enjoy things when we can you never know when they ' ll be taken away from us .
deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since qqq and joined the top flight only in the early qqq helsingfors ifk have been around since qqq but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the qqq so i think you ' re exagerating here that ' s a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian american olympic teams have been and they ' ve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice the qqq olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl as for the yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have been qqq line players in the nhl while robb stauber has done well for the kings in goal nothing more in fact i ' m sure that an all star team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently are doing but what happens if _ all _ top class finnish swedish players gradually end up with helsinki stockholm as the north american based ones gradually retire and no canadian american team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhl based players qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq regular qqq qqq regular qqq qqq player finland d jyrki lumme qqq d teppo numminen qqq d peter ahola qqq c jari kurri qqq c christian ruuttu qqq r teemu selanne qqq l esa tikkanen qqq obviously selanne ' s ratings would be higher today than they were in january sweden d ulf samuelsson qqq d fredrik olausson qqq d niklas lidstrom qqq d calle johansson qqq d kjell samuelsson qqq d tommy sjodin qqq d tommy albelin qqq c mats sundin qqq c thomas steen qqq r thomas sandstrom qqq r ulf dahlen qqq r michael nylander qqq l per erik eklund qqq l johan garpenlov qqq l mikael andersson qqq l jan erixon qqq this would be interesting clearly finland ' s top five players winnipeg ' s selanne numminen vancouver ' s lumme los angeles jari kurri and new york ' s tikkanen are right up there with any five man unit pittsburgh co have but i have my doubts about the home based finnish players the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie qqq qqq or the players listed above and luck there ' s presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n ' t be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a qqq team in the nhl sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america their points total qqq players is qqq seven more than ottawa ' s qqq top players combined if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in sweden an all swedish team would assemble about qqq qqq skill points deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players the swedish team would finish in sixth place about as high as boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk is n ' t completely unfounded here an all finnish all swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time wo n ' t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game however if free agency becomes a factor the top scandinavian players still might end up playing for large market teams after a couple of years the same way edmonton ' s dynasty crumbled in the late qqq some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all i ' d settle for a compromise prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players after this the amateur draft should be open to anyone .
well they just said that franco will probably go on the dl tomorrow they mentioned a career minor leaguer as the warm body who would go along i forget also when answering questions about the rotation coleman sd broadcaster said that hurst is gone in about a month month and a half which is when he should finish re hab later dennis
you know you ' re absolutely right i think we should round up all those players of european descent and ship ' em back to where they came from let ' s see with whom should we start i dunno lemieux hmmm sounds like he has french blood in him hey france is part of europe send that euro blooded boy back sheesh i do n ' t think it would be hard to find some native americans or native canadians for that matter who would dispute your claim to this great continent of ours ya see if you believe the anthropologists we ' re all immigrants of some sort if you really do n ' t think that mogilny bure selanne et al have improved the nhl then i ' m not sure you understand the game .
little i know what you mean i glow everytime ronnie ' s out on the ice in fact one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person is that i can key in on him instead of watching what i ' d probably be seeing on tv he does so many subtle things behind the play he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two way hockey that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part could n ' t and would n ' t play a lick of defense it ' s really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the pens you mention rick tocchet and he has certainly helped and even ol kjell has been steady but looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it would n ' t matter if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be qqq tom barrasso qqq ron francis qqq larry murphy i ' d love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso )

i basically agree the tigers are my favorite team actually their pitching might actually be better this year than last not that htat ' s saying a hole lot how ' bout that home opener on tuesday by the way sparky goes for win qqq today .
this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game the argument was qqq defense or runs allowed is qqq of the game qqq unearned runs amount to qqq of the runs allowed earned runs qqq qqq since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is qqq of defense and pitching is qqq of defense qqq caombining with qqq pitching is qqq of the game fielding qqq pete is usually sharper than that my own feel is that fielding is in the qqq qqq of defense range call it qqq qqq between fielding and pitching i ' d give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe qqq qqq or even qqq qqq give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which would n ' t be that unreasonable and even if you do n ' t let roberto steal a single base they ' ll score a lot more than the oleruds by going first to third more often no offense gordon .
oh yeah how come dino could never take the caps out of the patrick division he choked up qqq games to qqq last year and got swept away in the second round two years ago he rarely if ever makes it out of the division so are the islanders but they can still pull it out vancouver has winnipeg ' s number so it really does n ' t matter kings always seem to go at least qqq or qqq they never play a four or five game serious there ' s a difference between battling it out and pulling it out as i take calgary to pull it out in qqq .
only problem is that zombo was traded to st louis last year for goalie vincent riendeau i think that while chevy is not among the elite class of goalies he is adequate given the offensive firepower of the wings .

here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list in a discussion between me and chris lerch the subject of springfield ' s qqq round upset of the providence bruins came up chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians he noted that the offices for the league are in spring and many ex indians are working for the ahl furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup finals between roch and spring that the amerks charged favoritism by the office and that there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and staff attending all games with the springfield brass including sitting in their box for the game in springfield and according to the rochester media openly cheering for springfield certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true i do n ' t know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the amerks they have pulled this sort of crap against the wings before but if true this is somthing that seriously raises questions about president jack butterfield ' s leadership btw this was posted with the permission of chris

quoting bill gregory to all bg hey i saw that game i thought the sabres looked better that you bg described it ' s boston that looked weak and unsure of themselves even bg if big if they bruins win the third game what ' s that going to bg prove they be lucky well now the sabres are up qqq qqq in games and its to bad that boston is n ' t putting up more of a fight as that could have been the best series of the playoffs i think boston will come out smoking in the next two games and that buffalo will end the series in game six back in buffalo and say how about those islanders they are up qqq qqq on the capitals and will probably win the series only to be clobbered by the penguins who should eliminate the devils in the next game i can not see i ' m sad to say anyone beating the penguins this year again and they will take cup qqq i ' m afraid well talk to ya later steve

actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the third you forgot about gretzky if any of these guys start scoring the kings will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as well stauber will be in net on tuesday hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name robb stopper stauber i believe this is how they are i know it is gretzky and sandstrom but he has been putting a number of people on left also the carson robataille kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other lines hopefully it is evident that the scoring drought is getting to luc after his slight breakaway in the third i think he was steamed on the bench this emotion might help him break his streak also i have noticed blake has had a few really good chances to score but has fanned or shot wide is the injury still affecting him the e d g e

philadelphia at chicago teams tied for qqq after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series one friday one saturday and a good old sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging it ' s pitching it ' s always been pitching that we ' ve lacked announced ryne sandberg if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning preferrably qqq of the last three we ' ll know we might be able to win lord i hope we pull it off the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third rose went to second on the play christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw qqq qqq walks this year chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in right center cool papa bell ' s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat teams are starting to realize that you do n ' t have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and it ' s a credit to the phillies that they ' ve been able to sustain their pace the picthers have slumped at times so came the analysis from frank chance the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and after sandberg made out billy williams singled home a run in the sixth ron santo launched a two run homer to make it qqq qqq dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered larry bowa grounded into a qqq qqq qqq double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinch running at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning the cubs took the win qqq qqq moving a game behind the phillies steve carlton was called upon to battle qqq brown saturday to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was qqq qqq cubs after six innings the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed qqq more runs to ice an qqq qqq triumph sunday ' s twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off robin roberts grover alexander of the phils took the first contest qqq qqq but the cubs captured the second one qqq qqq with waddell gaining the win bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth the cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday montreal at st louis ( august qqq qqq qqq tie for qqq dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters and while they are n ' t among the all time greats they are getting the job done after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only qqq qqq games out of first in this wacky season martinez triumphed qqq qqq on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean qqq qqq saturday however the cardinals refused to give up winning qqq qqq on sunday the cards captured monday ' s game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers qqq qqq we ' re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock i do n ' t see why we ca n ' t win this division the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them two thirds of the way through the season there is a qqq tie for first new york at pittsburgh ( august qqq qqq qqq straight qqq qqq wins for bucs now qqq back but in qqq when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitcher ' s park like this spoke gil hodges before the series keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra qqq qqq wins the pirates have made only qqq errors all season qqq ahead of the second place dodgers error totals tend to be around qqq for the best defensive all time teams rube foster defeated sid fernandez qqq qqq friday and candelaria outshone seaver qqq qqq saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense when nolan ryan and two relivers qqq the mets in another qqq qqq win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the qqq mark they had been unable to several times in the past month bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two run blast by ralph kiner for the pirates the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinch ran for gary carter at second with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinch hit the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to win the pirates had scored an improbable qqq straight qqq qqq wins and had moved to within qqq games of first place with seven weeks to go san francisco at boswaukta ( august qqq qqq another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just would n ' t tire in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a qqq rotation again for a little while juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves qqq qqq willie mays had all four r . b . i . s on qqq hits rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair qqq qqq willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each the braves had collected qqq home runs going into sunday ' s doubleheader putting them on a pace for qqq which would be qqq short of the national league record they were still a tad behind the qqq yankees pace they had allowed over qqq though vida blue actually got the win after retiring qqq batters in the fifth he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh joe mcginnity earned the save in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won qqq qqq the giants took the second game however by a qqq qqq score the homer by aaron was a magical qqq by the braves however they fell to three game below qqq making a comeback extremely unlikely san diego at cincinnati ( aug qqq qqq randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this qqq series and the padres felt rather good with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better mcgriff ' s batting average was even rising of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up jones pitched a good game friday and won qqq qqq mcgriff launched two home runs mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday qqq qqq was the final score tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a qqq qqq tie through eight innings before departing the game was scoreless for qqq more innings until the thirteenth paige had departed after qqq and john franco hurled a scoreless inning tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a qqq qqq win the three game sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them brookangeles at houston ( august qqq qqq another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them i ca n ' t afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we ca n ' t davis will get decked once the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park homers for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a qqq high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs the foul poles are qqq feet from home plate but the alleys are qqq feet away with center field at qqq feet it ' s as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i ca n ' t hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed qqq weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch he responded with a two run double but wynn playing first for davis popped up and the astros did n ' t score any more in that inning they did score qqq in the fourth to erase a qqq qqq deficit and the astros wound up winning qqq qqq they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at qqq a . m before the game i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained how can we do that pee wee reese wondered they ' re going to be beating the ball down so we ' ve got to be ready to throw on the run steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws we ' ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time the plan almost worked mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third qqq qqq astros was the final with dave smith earning another save the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a qqq qqq dodger win fernando valenzuela lost the second game qqq qqq to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough we ' re mostly a power team remarked ron cey jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then we ' re sunk in a place like the astrodome i guess that ' s why they ' re so successful there indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most

actually the way i understand it it is an octapus apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on the ice and the announcer said octapi will not occupy the ice or something like that and it ' s happened ever since the fans cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and boo those who use a shovel .

hey man having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey i ' m ready to invest in hockey equipment particularly since i will be taking summer hockey lessons however i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment i ' ve checked out local stores and looked at catalogs but i was hoping to solicit opinions suggestions before actually plunking down any money having played football in high school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison but for example what are the advantages disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants girdles are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles etc so any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated .
no argument at all with murphy he scared the hell out of me when he came in last year on the other hand the club though enough of boever to put him into an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances he did at least at some point he seemed to be a very viable setup guy but i guess that ' s not considered that crucial by the club i can just remember two years ago so well though i ' m not that concerned those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries not old i expect them to come through just fine it ' s those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part even if they are coming through right now this sounds like their old road unis pretty dull buttons or pullovers i ' ll check through my uniform book to see if they ' ve always had some orange well we ' ll see i ' ve got a astros pullover shirt with the astros stripes across the shoulders and i have trouble making myself wear it in public i can see why they might want that to change gee if they eliminate the orange will they reupholster the seats in the astros stripes section what used to be the gold and yellow levels i do n ' t know those numbers they use now i saw a pinstripe version of an astros cap and i actually thought it looked good !

first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches and while it ' s true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this is only true when they do n ' t become extra long quickly pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better bring back the two hour baseball game and the three and a half hour golf game with it )
too bad he does n ' t bring the ability to hit pitch field or run .
mr bettman the guy in the wrong sport mr stein the guy who should be in charge but is n ' t of course we also need new names for the individual awards and other stuff like the president ' s cup president ' s cup the trophy given to the best regular season team hart winner the most valuable player chosen from the guys in the middle the guys on the right the guys on the left the guys back there and the guy in the net though typically given only to the guys in the middle and the guys on the left and on the right norris winner the best guy in the back or the guy who was awarded for something even though he is not one of the guys in the middle or on the left or the right ad nauseum keith keller let ' s go rangers let ' s go quakers kkeller @ mail . sas . upenn . edu ivy league champs !
well bruins fans it ' s playoff time again it looks like the b ' s have peaked at the right time getting out of the adams is going to be a cat fight to the end after what they did to montreal and quebec these teams will be out for revenge if neely can stay healthy and both bourque and moog stay sharp we should get to see neely finally take out two years of frustration on ulf i do n ' t fight samuelson i do n ' t agree with fighting in the nhl but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good it ' s him this is going to be a good series go bruins !
a lot of batters lean in when pitches come rickey ' s crouch tends to exaggerate that i think a great player to watch if you forget who he is unbiased hmmm .
has jack lost a bit of his edge what is the worst start jack morris has had uh jack lost his edge about qqq years ago and has had only one above average year in the last qqq again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky you can count on good tomorrow lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a bad finish last year yes i am enjoying every last run he gives up who was it who said morris was a better signing than viola hey valentine i do n ' t see boston with any world series rings on their fingers oooooo cheap shot damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future who cares he had two of them before he came to toronto and if the jays had signed viola instead of morris it would have been frank who won qqq and got the ring and he would be on his way to qqq this year too therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing your logic is curious and spurious there is no reason to believe that viola would n ' t have won as many games had he signed with toronto when you compare their stupid w l records be sure to compare their team ' s offensive averages too now looking at anything like the morris viola sweepstakes a year later is basically hindsight but there were plenty of reasons why it should have been apparent that viola was the better pitcher based on previous recent years and also based on age frank is almost qqq years younger how many knew that people got caught up in the qqq world series and then on morris qqq wins last year wins are the stupidest most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than rbi or r that he won qqq just means that the jays got him a lot of runs the only really valid retort to valentine is were n ' t the red sox trying to get morris too oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say and do n ' t tell me boston will win this year they wo n ' t even be in the top qqq in the division more like qqq if this is true it wo n ' t be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares ?

i looked up might to see why you selected that particular word and discovered the line to express permission liberty probability possibility it also said something about being a polite alternative to may the presence of probability possibility can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection so i ' d say to all extents and purposes yes you might in fact you did not that you were asking me specifically the next question is why would a mailing list be more appropriate we do n ' t all get mailing lists we surely do n ' t all get mailing lists about the teams about which we are most enthused so it seems to me r . s . baseball is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one does n ' t necessarily follow day to day this is not intended as flamage but rather is an attempted answer as you posed your post as a question .

as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulf ' s head is gon na solve the problem with violence in the sport of hockey how the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it with your back assward mentality saying that hurting a player will solve anyone ' s problems is asinine new rules and a new referee system need to be instituted right now too many of the real goons get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to be i ' ve seen koharski and van hellemond to name a few with their heads up their asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the play even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an improvement .

atlantic division st john ' s maple leafs vs moncton hawks moncton hawks see cd islanders moncton is a very similar team to cdi low scoring defensive good goaltending john leblanc and stu barnes are the only noticable guns on the team but the defense is top notch and mike o ' neill is the most underrated goalie in the league bri as i have tried to tell you since qqq february michael o ' neill might be the most underrated goalie in the ahl but he isn ' t in the ahl he ' s on the winnipeg jets injury list as he has been since his first nhl start against the ottawa senators he ' s out until next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation stu barnes might be an ahl gun for the hawks but he ' s now the third line center with the jets and has been since mid january or so sorry my memory is gone i thought that o ' neill got sent back down in february but i must have been given incorrect info i guess this says it all about moncton because barnes is still one of their top qqq or so scorers even though he ' s been out since january .

sherri nichols writes or a young don bordello there ' s a strong possibility that the bucs have absolutely no other catching prospects in the minors at this point at least nobody ready for any serious aaa majors duty the main reason they might have stayed with prince could be just age especially if spanky was creeping toward his qqq or something all things considered though i ' d be a lot more comfortable with spanky behind the plate than prince is n ' t there decent backup backstop out there looking for work ?
i think that nhlpa qqq is the best video game available now of course many things could be done better but i really appreciate that the names of players are the real ones no matter if it lacks some logos i am still playing it since november leading different teams to the finals and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring yesterday i won the title using toronto against hartford qqq games to two i played the playoffs in a qqq games fashion qqq minutes for each period and the best scorer and shooter was gilmour qqq shots if i remember well _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ iskander ayari

dave winfield ' s name does not go in terms of peak and i repeat peak years winfield has done it all he has batted in the qqq ' s for a season drove in qqq and more runs many times in a row before his injury consistently hit at or near qqq while knocking in qqq home runs have you even looked at dave winfield ' s slugging percentage for three or qqq of his best seasons i still think that dave was one of the better of all time but obviously not the best he was one of the best athletes evr to play baseball he hit line drives that hit the scoreboard in left center field a feat np one has done in the new stadium heck only qqq or qqq other people have hit it over that green fence since it has been remodeled he could field had a bullet arm and his hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields and barry bonds of last season he is older now and slowing down takes more of an uppercut to lift the ball out of the park but he will always be my hero and my idol there is nothing that could make me happier than george inviting dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the yankees of course he will most likely refuse the offer but who knows for qqq million dollars he ' ll play heck they are giving gallego qqq million this year having dave as their dh while leaving him time to play the field when tartabull is injured or nokes and mass are traded should give the yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age of yankee domination .
he ' s been playing horrible defense baylor said after wednesday ' s game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little because bichette has been having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting he was true to his word i went to thursday ' s game and gerald young was in right and daryl boston who has a very hot bat was in left baylor was careful to say though that he did n ' t necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well in defense of bichette it looks like right field in mile high stadium is a bitch to play some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursday ' s game )

absolute nonsense the decision that was made was pocklington ' s he chose qqq mill over gretzky if gretzky was n ' t upset about not being able to win a cup in la then i submit that he was n ' t worth the qqq mill how do you know what he thinks or thought the only thought that i can see that you have revealed is your own you do n ' t like gretzky big deal the real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty what the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the ref wo n ' t be fooled i ca n ' t imagine why anyone would expect someone like lemieux to change his game why do n ' t you pick on qqq dimensional over rated type like hull and salami -
bleagh this was a terrific trade snow will certainly be better than mattingly in the future but that they ' ll be about the same now is a defensible opinion abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in the game today i ' m not sure about this one i think that it ' s good in that a qqq boggs kicks hayes meulens whoevers ass and that a qqq boggs still is n ' t all that shabby it ' s bad though that the yankees expect a qqq boggs and will probably get a qqq boggs however i ' d still play boggs over hayes or bam bam you have my full agreement here he ' s not all that much better than velarde and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him however i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname not that this helps the yankees i strongly disagree i ' d much much rather have a hundred games of tartabull and sixty games of dion james than qqq games of james .
it was not just those penalties most of all it was the penalty the referee did n ' t call on the czechs right before their first goal do n ' t you think it ' s quite silly to call it a nazi attitude when some people throw coins on the ice hey i do n ' t approve the behavior of these guys especially not in a wc game but i ca n ' t see any reason for using the word nazi in this connection soccer hooligans are not just a german problem remember the world cup in italy again there ' s a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop windows or fighting with other so called fans who come to a wc just to see if the dutch or the english or the germans are the best bruisers which other sports are you talking about i do n ' t think soccer is every possible sport how many germans do you know do you think qqq out of qqq is most of them if you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the us what do you think about the americans most of them like beating blacks ?

i know you have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers alomar to baerga must be a jay lover and indian hater sorry you got that one wrong i hate the jays and do n ' t care one way or the other about the indians but objectively alomar had the better offensive year last year so i have to pick him you admit t & p as a reliable objective source then you will note that they rated alomar as the better offensive player chosing baerga over alomar only because of his defense that ' s a joke alomar might not be a gold glover but he ' s certainly no worse than baerga defensively )

the flyers blew a qqq qqq lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineen ' s qqq career hat trick powered them to their qqq consecutive win qqq qqq over the sabres who have now lost qqq in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his qqq and qqq goals of the season which tied the game at qqq in the qqq period and qqq in the qqq tommy soderstrom stopped qqq of qqq shots on goal to improve his own record to qqq qqq qqq as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night roster move andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch lines eklund lindros recchi beranek brind ' amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy faust acton brown galley bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only qqq shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up qqq shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric qqq way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at qqq for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the qqq consecutive penalty kill for the flyers keith carney took a holding penalty at qqq for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league did n ' t allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at qqq to give the sabres another power play but they could n ' t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were qqq qqq buffalo after the flyers had led qqq qqq at one point mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwell ' s trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and they ' d do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it ' s russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that they ' re qqq years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer he ' s very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at qqq of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr did n ' t know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at qqq then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at qqq the sabres coudln ' t get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a qqq on qqq but brind ' amour hustled ahead to make it a qqq on qqq and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it qqq qqq flyers at qqq that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake qqq he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake qqq galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he did n ' t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at qqq two streaks end for the flyers qqq of shutout hockey and qqq straight penalty kills lindros put them right back on the power play at qqq with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but could n ' t get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty qqq for slashing qqq fighting and qqq for the major qqq minutes of power play time for the sabres at qqq barnaby only got qqq the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at qqq to close the flyers lead to qqq qqq lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another mini breakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at qqq for his qqq of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the qqq and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles that was all in the qqq shots were qqq qqq sabres into the qqq period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a qqq on qqq acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at qqq the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up qqq way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his qqq at qqq qqq qqq flyers but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstrom ' s qqq hole for his qqq at qqq to tie the game at qqq then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at qqq the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brind ' amour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek ' s glove side at qqq play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at qqq the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brind ' amour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq qqq hat trick of the season for dineen qqq of his career qqq shorthanded goal of the game for him qqq of the season then carney took a tripping penalty at qqq to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the qqq on qqq and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres were n ' t able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers would n ' t allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind ' amour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his qqq of the season at qqq on his qqq birthday that was all the scoring shots were qqq qqq buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who had n ' t been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high qqq point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i do n ' t think so the flyers longest winning streak in qqq years qqq goals for only qqq against with three shutouts eric lindros is qqq in league with qqq even strength goals despite missing qqq games with injury qqq points out of qqq clinched qqq place since the rangers lose the tie breaker a couple misc notes forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstrom ' s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future same paper had a blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year his response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would

matt ' s problem is really more ability than attitude it is n ' t that he ' s got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that he ' s still a total sucker for the curve ball it looked for a while in qqq that he was getting better but it ' s still his weak point as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the net . stat . mavens will probably tell you there ' s no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a self fulfilling prophecy as to whether the giants lineup is optimal who knows batting bonds the team ' s best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the qqq and qqq hitters are n ' t exactly messrs oba so they are n ' t giving much up there and although clark is n ' t the overall offensive force that bonds is he seems better suited to the qqq spot assuming of course that he starts hitting one of these days .

i ' d have to take quebec in qqq hawks will win but it will take qqq cal in qqq boston will beat quebec in qqq pitt in qqq the bruins are nt a pushover the hawks have nt had problems with them all year yep i agree unless the hawks can somehow change fate you ' re right who knows though maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal hawks style will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team maybe the pens are due for a let down hell how could they _ possibly _ extend their record making play all the way through the playoffs ?
being a a blues fan i do n ' t get to see much else from around the league with the exception of hockey night on espn i ca n ' t get the blues games where i go to school thus i do n ' t get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the hawks but last night i got to catch a glimpse of the caps isles game it occurred to me that turgeon is a stud on skates his moves are quick and brilliant you ny fans should be proud p . s who won the game caps isles ?
in a philadelphia inquirer a few days ago it was reported that there were two qqq plans for a new phillies stadium the already mentioned qqq street station proposal and a location near broad street and race street i think i ca n ' t remember the exact details but the stadium would be build practically downtown there is a small lot that could be used according to the paper the qqq street plan has run into some trouble because amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium i do n ' t have an opinion just yet just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon however because nobody wants to pay for it keith keller let ' s go rangers let ' s go quakers kkeller @ mail . sas . upenn . edu ivy league champs !
before i begin lambasting don cherry let me first say that i ' ve been sort of a cherry fan for a while admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly but he ' s more or less harmless on saturday however he crossed the lines of good taste this is the best he can do gee don tremendous amounts of professionalism here the cbc looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with this nonsense making fun of names it ' s bad enough that he makes asinine blanket statements about european players but he ' s now resorted to making fun of their names too he sounded like an idiot much like he did last week when he said that teemu would never make it to his rock ' em sock ' em video until he dropped the gloves well what he _ said _ was that even though he ' s been around the league for quite some time he still does n ' t know who ' s where w . r . t conference and division names hello mcfly the names have been around for a couple of decades or so he also invited the audience to name the teams in the wales quick quick followed by ah you do n ' t know i do n ' t know sorry don wrong on this one this was absolutely hilarious don ' s argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly good unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in the nba case serious money oh well he ' s never been one for objectivity has he don ' s question to gretzky :
so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins that ' s immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on joe think about what you ' re saying who they played is very significant why they played them is what ' s irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders yes it does absolutely in the context of comparing two goaltenders of course at the end of the season qqq points is qqq points no matter how you get them and on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts but if you ' re a coach deciding between two goalies or a gm looking to make a trade you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets i did n ' t see the second toronto game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece there was nothing in that game to judge tommy soderstrom on because he was n ' t tested the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but if you were to look at the qqq qqq tie against the habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a qqq goalie in action roussel does n ' t have a game like that in him do n ' t be so sure of that flyers management never says bad thing about roussel but they do n ' t say too much on the good side either i ' ve seen at least two interviews where every time farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders it was tommy this tommy that and oh yeah dom has played well too flyers in the nhl hall of fame kinda dull really they handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza hut but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid season had names like benning kasper mostly random seat locations some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos i do n ' t like that method since i ' ve seen guards help out people get things like lindros pictures surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they ' d hold ' em for their buddies .

roger you should check your facts before posting the kings have conceded qqq goals in qqq games .
there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena you might have to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them look on the street under the message board or out on the street in front of the hyatt or even around gate qqq the later you buy them the less money you ' ll pay and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time might be better to pick them up earlier now though .
subject sez it wondering if either team are in town that weekend qqq qqq qqq i can probably get phillies tix as the vet can hold a bunch and i hope they ' re still in qqq but it ' s late may and camden yards is a problem is there any way of getting in the park w / o an sro ticket any advice if there at home joe leonard jle @ world . std . com
that ' s very true i live in richmond home of the aaa richmond braves and they have this guy ryan klesko who hit qqq hr ' s at home last year now that does n ' t sound like a whole lot but the way the diamond is built home runs are a rarity in fact ron gant brian hunter and david justice all proved they could hit in richmond when they were sent to the majors they never came back if you can hit in richmond you can hit anywhere .
i ' ve been saying that for at least qqq years now and even the a ' s conditioning guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back although i do n ' t for one second believe jose used steroids his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame ( see jeff bregel ex qqq as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his frame i ca n ' t imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back i do n ' t know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the a ' s and had no problems with it then it might be that pre back problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused but now he ' s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him the old saying if you ' re hot its a trigger mechanism if you ' re cold its a hitch the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he ' s comfortable with for more than a few months he changes his stance so much he loses track of where the strike zone is in wednesday ' s night game he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he ' s changed his stance so much i ' m also a bit concerned that because he ' s got palmer and gonzalez hitting all the homeruns he ' ll become competitive swing even harder and screw himself up even worse larussa always said that canseco ' s famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits .
oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy did n ' t hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield now entering his i believe qqq big league season is still a damn decent hitter admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i do n ' t know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players kingman was a one dimension power hitter he could n ' t field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp was n ' t that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absolute primo dick eddie murray yup only the best qqq baseman of the qqq ' s i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in qqq it seems that he was n ' t overrated by the media lee smith hmmmm this one ' s actually pretty close he ' s had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway i ' d have to take a closer look at the stats it ' s been a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves does n ' t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hof ' er lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game isn ' t marginal now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop his defense was so good that he ' s won something along the lines of qqq gold gloves again gold gloves are mediot biased and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie ' s more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early qqq ' s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozzie ' s offense you ask good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer but still a definite asset offensively yount qqq hits mvp at two different positions uh huh a real stiff his qqq was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go he ' s a clear hof ' er imho well as far as garvey goes you ' re right garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey should n ' t be in the hof skyjack i ' ve said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in qqq he may be damned close to done but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the qqq ' s for up and down tiger teams while qqq was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time after all nolan never won a cy damn he ' s just pitcher who hung around for qqq years his w l record is mediocre of course nolan ' s a hof ' er puck probably although he ' s got to play reasonably well for a few more years qqq years even good ones are n ' t enough to make the hof most likely that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden he ' s very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cf ' s in the game since he joined the league i ' ve always liked the guy and i hope he does make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really it ' s too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it it ' s an interesting subject here ' s an off the top of my head list of potential hof ' ers from each team i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up i wo n ' t consider anyone who started playing after about qqq again too early to tell note these are all active players i ' m not counting recent retirees baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig ' s record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange cubs sandberg lock st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously he ' s got to regain past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what he ' ll tell you los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if you ' re awake before i get flames this is an off the top of the head list there ' s probably a few deserving candidates that i left off and i did n ' t include barry bonds will clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc because i only considered guys who started playing before qqq e mail or post i almost fear what i may have started here .
how exactly would ferreira accomplished this the three headed gm ship has taken a lot of heat but nobody ' s explained how things would have been any different had ferreira still been there would ferreira have made more trades who would have he had traded would he have made fewer trades who should not have been traded ?
yeah i think that the flames and the flyers traded captains once mel bridgeman for brad marsh .
i agree that keenan is an excellent choice did you see mike lupica ' s column in sunday ' s news my sentiments exactly i think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire into their hearts next season either that or he ' s going to be kicking alot of butt i ' m here but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly quiet you know doing the lurking thing i do n ' t have a sense how many rangers fans there are on the list either i am a die hard ranger fan i guess i have to be i sat in the garden throughout the penguins led by mario ' s qqq goals decimation of them on qqq but am sick at the abundance of talent that has been totally untapped and the lack of heart displayed this season hurlbut was injured for quite a while i ' m not sure but i think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run and if so like you question why he was n ' t used i believe kocur was used in many instances for his intimidation factor granted he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for that reason alone but you have to realize that when a team is not doing any real physical intimidation i ' d like to have a nickel for every time j . d said they ' ve got to take the body more you ' ve got to at least have some illusions i agree and i do n ' t know sorry i do n ' t agree with you here i think joey c did a good job filling in when he was asked to i ca n ' t imagine that it ' s easy going from near qqq ice time to being a full timer i do n ' t seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too much or failing to clear the zone he worked hard and at least did n ' t make any rookie mistakes as he said himself in an interview he can only give what he has and he did absolutely i think attendance at the garden was better on the last day of the season than any average night for the islanders the man is awesome in a way i ' m enjoying the playoffs more now that the rangers are n ' t in them i can really appreciate all the glory mario is getting without hating him because he ' s on the opposing team he deserves it all as far as i ' m concerned mary
hello could someone tell me if and where i could find faceoff stats for the qqq season and later on the qqq i think its to early to get it now thanks a lot
i ' ve noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the marlines to finish ahead of the cubs how first base grace vs destrade could destrade be the second coming of cecil fielder i doubt it if destrade performs to the height of expectations then even otherwise edge to cubs second base sandberg vs barberie no contest sandberg will be back may qqq edge to cubs a big edge shortstop vizcaino vs weiss vizcaino is excellent defensively but is an automatic out at bat weiss is n ' t much better with the stick even third base dave magadan vs buechelle magadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter buechelle has more power and is better defensively i think edge to florida catcher santiago vs wilkins wilkins is ok but santiago is better edge to marlins left field conine vs maldonado wow qqq for qqq yesterday i know conine has potential i watched him play at omaha the last couple years until he actually proves himself i give maldonado the edge however like at qqq this is position where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year center scott pose vs wilson may edge to may even if wilson hopefully the cubs will use may and save wilson for pinch running and the like may is n ' t ken griffey jr but he will hit qqq with qqq homers if he plays full time right felix vs sosa felix jose has occasional power and a bad obp so does sosa but sosa also has speed and a good glove edge to cubs starters aquino armstrong hammond a lot of fifth starters here the cubs wo n ' t remind anyone of the brave staff but morgan castillo guzman hibbard is average to ok better than the marline edge to cubs middle relief even the cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the marlins carpenter anf klink or decent but so are assenmacher and mcelroy closer a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins meyers is decent but no harvey of course the cubs may have a few more games to save look for qqq saves qqq blown from meyers and qqq saves qqq blown with a better era for harvey edge florida overall an edge to chicago neither of these teams will threaten to win anything of course e msilverm @ nyx . cs . du . edu go cubs !

bleep bleep bleep the bruins lost again in o . t i ca n ' t stand it aside from frustrated ravings i must give buffalo credit they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense boston players ca n ' t seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasions the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he ' s also getting plenty of help boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the series score of qqq qqq but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game as a result boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the qqq period qqq goals down this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single game the outlook for the bruin ' s advancement to the second round are quite bleak imho the bruins need to score first if they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the sabres in the qqq and qqq periods the scary thing is that i ' ll be going to grad school in buffalo next year i ' ll never cheer for the sabres you ca n ' t convert me qqq

it ' s the opening game effect maybe pros arrive late nervousness for rookie wc players and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these worse nations i ' d guess that the better team you face in the opening game the better it is since the chances of an upset are greater then some other reasons why the worse teams are so tough to beat was presented by hans virus lindberg former coach in switzerland qqq the worse teams referring to france switzerland austria italy etc have now usually world class goalies qqq their defensive play have become much more disciplined they take much less unnecessary penalties qqq they use four lines which makes it harder to make them run out of gas qqq the ice quality in the german wc rinks is poor another weird thing was that the czechs played entertaining hockey err just kidding david alex that ' s a new name for me ok i forgot the czech roster at home yesterday but now i have it i do n ' t know the teams for all players so i would appreciate if you guys could fill in the blanks for me especially i think some of these players play in finland the czech republic goaltenders qqq petr briza finland somewhere right qqq roman turek motor c budejovice defense qqq leo gudas qqq milos holan tj vitkovice qqq drahomir kadlec qqq bedrich scerban brynas sweden qqq antonin stavjana hv qqq sweden qqq miroslav horava modo sweden qqq ales flasar tj vitkovice forwards qqq petr rosol qqq kamil kastak hv qqq sweden qqq richard zemlicka qqq jiri kucera qqq jan caloun hc litvinov qqq petr hrbek qqq tomas kapusta qqq otakar janecky finland qqq roman horak motor c budejovice qqq martin hostak modo sweden qqq radek toupal qqq jiri dolezal staffan

whoa are n ' t you forgetting a couple of guys named gant and justice he can lead off he ' ll probably steal qqq he might hit qqq he ' ll never hit qqq homers i think you went qqq for qqq on this one you said it all right there does anyone else out there not like deon i think he ' s all hype his qqq season last year was good but i ' m not convinced that he can do it again it reminds me sorry of the year qqq when tim wallach hit qqq or so homers and had qqq rbi it never even came close to happening again of course maybe i just prefer guys who go about their business and do n ' t play it up for the attention just my ho doug roberts larry walker is god delino deshields thinks he is .

this is known as the savard syndrome and we are talking denis not serge no team will ever win squat with the likes of denis savard in their lineup they could tell savard to stay home and watch the games on tv sounds like qqq to me cordially as always rm
how is that possible he was on the albuquerque leftturns last year how could you possibly know what team he would be on if manny lee was on his team last year after all manny lee was n ' t on his team last year so it ' s complete unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the same team as manny lee last year it would have been the team of the toronto blue jays since he and lee were n ' t on the same team you can not possibly objectively state what team they would have been on if they had both been on the same team .
whoa there lighten up andrew when i was referring to you dorks at the western business school i was specifically referring to those assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of minnesota for no apparent reason being canadian and one who has friends who attended uwo i personally do n ' t want to be associated with the idiots who wrote those messages one more thing andrew until this season the leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen years have they won the cup during our lifetime so the north stars have n ' t been the only shit team in the norris .

i was at that game behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the radar gun the qqq season was winding down and roger did n ' t have his best fastball topping out at qqq qqq in contrast to frank tanana who went as low as qqq with one lollipop in the process of striking out phil plantier five times on the night inky ' s shot would have gone further than any i ' ve ever seen if it had n ' t crashed into the lights not the lightstand as you say over qqq feet high roy hobbs like and bounced back onto the field that had to have been a qqq if unobstructed edging out bo jackson ' s drive off oil can boyd to the top of the centerfield bleacher back wall in qqq for the best i ' ve seen personally i was sitting under that one glenn waugaman digital equipment corporation littleton ma g_waugaman @ nac . enet . dec . com

cdash @ moet . cs . colorado . edu charles shub writes what really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth between baseball and hockey after they stated that they could n ' t show the overtime period i turned back to espn around qqq and it was hockey great i pulled up a chair and watched then the first overtime period ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey something like qqq minutes later are they trying to alienate both hockey and baseball viewers at the same time as for martinsville i wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was no secret that it coincided with the draft why not let tnn broadcast it george
good question i kind of wondered about this myself just one thought i had on it the babe himself was in pride of the yankees which made me think a that version may be closer to the truth and b the babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even though some of the scenes did n ' t make him look completely flattering .
add boston ' s qqq as the bruins flagship station you probably wo n ' t pick it up anywhere outside of boston since it ' s only a qqq watt station the bruins also have network stations in all qqq new england states this could be the bruins last year on eei which also happens to be an all sports radio station the problem is that the bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station ( wmex qqq whenever there is a the same night conflict with the nba ' s boston celtics this happened qqq times during the course of the regular season ( the celtics own financially troubled weei the bruins might resurface on whdh qqq next year stay tuned .

now this is a legitimate point baseball is entertainment and i have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others regardless of their win value personally i ' m a huge fan of the slug bunt i doubt it ' s a high percentage play but i get a big kick out of it i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarraga ' s inability to defer gratification is n ' t hurting his team because he is n ' t paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever i ' m not sure i used to think this was true but more and more i ' m becoming convinced that it ' s the other way around among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot let ' s break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot power no power patient frank thomas brett butler barry bonds ozzie smith mark mcgwire craig grebeck babe ruth miller huggins ted williams billy hamilton rickey henderson eddie joost joe morgan mike hargrove impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen dave kingman shawon dunston joe carter andres thomas george bell jose lind kirby puckett devon white etc as far as i can tell all the categories are full it really looks like the two are independent nobody could possibly be afraid of craig grebeck at the plate and yet he walks quite a lot part of that undoubtedly is being small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of target at least qqq times out of qqq randy milligan is an even better example he ' s only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all over the place despite his huge strike zone .

more about the messier samuelsson incident i agree with rick that ulf ' s cross check was n ' t illegal it was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called slo mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are besides if messier ca n ' t take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen well matt mattias timmander has n ' t been playing with the modo elite league team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the b ' s i saw him play in the swedish championship game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does i suspect you would like to have a ulf type of player on the b ' s team too as for mariusz czerkawski he has had a great season for hammarby in division qqq he scored - if i remember correctly qqq points this season and then we have to keep in mind that a qqq point season in sweden is considered very good due to the limited number of games mariusz is djurgarden property he was just on loan to hammarby so he will play in elitserien next season unless the b ' s can get him of course i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in swedish hockey this season staffan

total baseball which also tries to evaluate a player ' s total offensive and defensive contributions gives barry bonds a total player rating of qqq for qqq only one other player since ruth attained that mark cal ripken for his qqq season rounding out the top five offensive players in the nl last season sheffield qqq sandberg qqq van slyke qqq and larkin qqq the top qqq offensive players in the al in qqq were e martinez qqq ventura qqq anderson qqq r henderson qqq and thomas qqq in short total baseball says bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons ever in the game ' s history better than any year had by mantle mays williams etc if you disagree do n ' t flame me flame the writers of total baseball also martinez and ventura are neck and neck so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis which one had the better year can be considered a toss up thus total baseball supports your choices of bonds and ventura as the mvps of qqq phil brown aka qqq |

hi all i ' ve been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or two without access to really important information i saw the qqq million shoulder back on the dl how long is he out for i . e how many millions inning will he get this year nothing personal against higuera mind you just wondering how bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current big producers go over a relative pittance please realize the term relative pittance can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball salaries additional questions i did ' nt get to see bones pitch this spring how is he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation how is surhoff shaping up defensively at third are they going to build a new stadium when ?
i was on vacation all last week and did n ' t see any news at all could somebody fill me in on how st louis ended up with mark whiten in a trade who did we give up arocha allen watson dmitri young or did dal make a decent deal :
the same bill james why do you say that it sounds like you ' re suggesting bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign noting that he was n ' t all world as a catcher or a hitter he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella which reports are those i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball you ' ve got ta play him imho he ' s a much better hitter although hernandez is n ' t a bad hitter right now it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiotti ' s caddy since he can catch the knuckler as long as they play up to their abilities the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but that ' s something that ' s difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent ' s sb and that ' s clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners catchers era is a possibility but it ' s subject to way too many biases as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too about the only chink in the braves armor is that they ' re weak offensively at several positions cf c qqq ss if belliard plays qqq unless bream and hunter form another super platoon and very weak defensively if blauser plays i ' d like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talent rich jays of recent years they ' ll be conservative and stick with what they have i ' m not saying that ' s wrong just conservative .
i did n ' t mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that specific deficiency i meant that if having bonds bat behind him gives williams possibly unfounded confidence that might translate into more hitting productivity but you ' re right if williams biggest problem is more physical than mental that ' s less likely to make a difference .
i knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still too much hockey for atlanta atlanta ' s abc has declined to pick up any playoff games till qqq and even when they show the games on qqq and qqq they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast i know this is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia alabama etc but it is still pretty annoying at least in pittsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate i asked them what their problem was i told them that a local qqq rating was not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time without much promotion besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs she told me that they had contractual obligations i asked her if golf was shown oin abc would contractual obligations come in the way and how come contractual obligations did n ' t come in the way of last week ' s telecast she then could n ' t give me a coherent answer also i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good i think abc and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with thier sports programming i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb qqq and complain bitterlyt about this tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation .

cool and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name calling of others one of the basic things you need to ok actually i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting vs non clutch the y axis being the number of players certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players as a counterexample to you wo n ' t hear those kind of accusations from me it is interesting that you selected maldonado because he is someone whom i have also looked at he has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of ba hitting in qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq admittedly he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs his clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent so for my purposes in qqq i would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance i do n ' t know how i would have felt in qqq but you may indeed be right when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non clutch ba ditto for joe carter this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base i completely accept that reasoning again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis amen the beastmaster

i ' d have to say the most impressive hrs i ' ve ever see came from dave kingman and his infamous moon raker drives .
for those of you who complain about don cherry and wonder why he is popular the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and joe garagiola and howard cosell john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his all madden team a lot over much better receivers for much the same reasons cherry sings the praises of doug gilmour a little guy with heart yet one does n ' t see a string of american posts saying that john madden has lost his marbles dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or that college with outrageous statements why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters in relation to our greatest passion which is hockey canadians are very similar to americans culturally our sports are just hockey and curling whereas with americans it is football basketball baseball and bowling .
i agree rob shick sucks big time he did the same thing last night ' s game between boston buffalo .
both protests would be denied of course the umpire ' s judgement determines the garbage thing although i think the game should be called but that ' s my personal opinion doesn ' t matter there is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless .
they did last world cup and eventually lost tp sweden in the final !
roger shut up thank you .

qqq peter ahola season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with pittsburgh for future considerations grade i b it is way too early to tell about ahola who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft ahola had only played qqq games this season i think it ' s actually less the san jose mercury news may be in err here qqq of them with the sharks in the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he has n ' t been spectacular and his offense is n ' t anything to write home about qqq points it ' s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be peter ahola qqq doug wilson season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i b i have often been accused of overly down on wilson i may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al are giving out nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for qqq place on the team qqq points in qqq games but next year which may be wilson ' s last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor qqq dean kolstad season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i c / d it ' s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games forgetting exact number but no more than qqq but at age qqq he ' s quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl in those games he did not impress anyone after generating qqq shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just qqq points in his tenure up here with the sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team qqq pat macleod season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad because the sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he would n ' t clear waivers in fact he has played the past qqq qqq weeks with kansas city but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs since he has played so little i ca n ' t even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills qqq tom pederson season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net including yours truly he demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring qqq points in qqq games however his size qqq qqq qqq lbs is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach but to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league qqq claudio scremin season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i d / d he played all of qqq games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of kolstad scremin at age qqq is quickly running out of time he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks the only notable thing that will go down in scremin ' s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre .

i ' ve seen it as colmn also blame the associated press after the official scorer balances the official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up using a template on a laptop and transmit it to the ap offices in new york rockefeller center via the telephone the box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over ap ' s news delivery services if there are corrections those are issued later it is the person sitting in front of a laptop at shea or whereever whose fault that is note the ap puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in most newspapers being the first one last week they were in denver maybe the ap person in denver did this remember they just started with mlb out there check tomorrow ' s paper qqq and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the same thing .

obviously some reporter for the ottawa sun got taken by an april fools joke probably started by someone with the nordiques or the bruins like for example who is going to reimburse the flyers for the qqq million they paid to the nordiques like the senators are going to get lindros and qqq million the flyers sent the equivalent of qqq or qqq players when you include the draft choices to quebec and they are going to get only four back some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a real good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media has chosen to publicize this utter nonsense can you think it can not possibly be true no need for the if i ca n ' t believe that anyone would consider giving such crap even the remotest consideration .

i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week while the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the oiler ' s future rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium northlands has offered to buy the oilers for qqq million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington as for me my opinion is divided edmonton has been fairly supportive of the oilers even though they ' re a small market team they had many sellouts in the qqq even with the problems that the team had this year they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did on the other hand if the team does move there is no place more deserving than hamilton of course how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of bettman following up on this the provincial government has been asked by the opposition to block any deal that pocklington is offering to hamilton the government said that pock is going nowhere why do n ' t i believe the government was n ' t it pocklington who wanted to be tory leader qqq years ago ?

viola has only played in the nl with the mets not possible for him to have defeated or lost to every team ditto for tanana who was mentioned in a previous post i do n ' t remember if seaver managed to get a win against the white sox in his brief sojourn with boston so i ' d say the other pitcher to defeat every team is either mike torrez he bounced around enough for a long enough period of time or koosman as mentioned i would also guess that if one of these two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team tom

does anybody in the pittsburgh area know why mike lavalliere was released last year i kept saying that slaught should get the bulk of the playing time that he was clearly the better player at this point but leyland insisted on keeping a pretty strict platoon and now he is released that does n ' t make any sense to me greg the story goes like this spanky is too slow if he were quicker he would still be here but with slaught and tom prince they did n ' t want to lose prince in order to bring up that qqq pitcher slaught is about as good as spanky and prince is coming along nicely do n ' t feel too bad for him he ' s still gon na get theat qqq over the next two years he ' ll be able to do most of what he wants to do .
you obviously do n ' t understand how tv scheduling works espn had prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance the nhl tv deal was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this one plus year out the nhl package was finished two weeks before the season started espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last minnesota game and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night but the bottom line is that espn can not break contracts at will they must honor the previous deals they made _ does _ have something to do with it especially if you risk a lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball so relax i ' m happy i do n ' t get sportschannel anyway .

i do n ' t buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool hextall gave up qqq very questionable goals himself both dionne ' s and bellows shots were misplayed by hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care roy stood on his head for the first qqq minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from end to end kamensky ' s mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero because roy ' s team did n ' t make full use of their opportunities hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces he played very well but the haller shot off the post in ot the rebound bouncing over bellows stick the brunet breakaway the qqq chances for leclair all those opportunities were not finished off by montreal and it cost them hextall was n ' t particularly brilliant on those plays sure no excuse but it was just the qqq goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them qqq opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary i disagree roy played well because he was n ' t screened the whole night the defense for the qqq time this season played remarkably keeping sakic nolan and sundin out of the slot most of the night this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss and hextall did n ' t on dionne ' s goal please roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies and he still is in the top qqq when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans why should they read the papers they played qqq minutes of burnsian hockey to shut down quebec all they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the extra qqq red light to face quebec rubbish that ' s a guaranteed way to end the series qqq qqq who would be taught a lesson by this the fans the media and racicot perhaps certainly not the rest of the team if you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an ot then i agree but the goal itself was a great piece of work by young roy had both the near and far posts covered but young flipped the puck up under roy ' s arm as he wrapped around the net not a bad goal at all .
only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox okay i ' m overstating still the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this year did not pitch in the majors last year huh imo this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues in gammons defense because the talent drain came from the al as well some increase will be seen he also gets credit for mentioning that the qqq jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the qqq season he ' s still full of it .

how do you figure that when bryan murray took over the wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked unlikely to win it now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it a truly great gm would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup a good gm like murray can maintain the team ' s success but ca n ' t push them to the next level in the history of hockey there have been several better gm ' s than murray way too many to name murray is n ' t even the best gm in the league today he fails in comparison to sinden sather savard caron fletcher and quinn in my estimation i ca n ' t imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen in hockey unless they have seen very few gm ' s .

are most players who come up young always good when they ' re young or later damn i was afraid you would say that well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion and i happen to agree i can believe that i ' m a newbie here so i ' ll take your word but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning sorry new do n ' t know nichols law do n ' t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please do n ' t tell me how to run my business especially when i ' m being successful i ' m sure you could be right you could also be smoking some illegal substance hey that ' s a joke do n ' t get offended please well i ca n ' t cite anyone ' s ethical rectitude because i do n ' t know what it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then that ' s what the braves should do i happen to believe that it ' s a baseball decision while you from your armchair may disagee i do n ' t i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training i think it is a very normal decision to have made it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers sure it may be conservative it may also be logical i do n ' t know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me the beastmaster
the last name is niedermayer as in new jersey ' s scott ' s last name because you guessed it they are brothers but rob niedermayer is a center not a defenseman i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya they are n ' t saying much but they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov along with kariya chris pronger ' s name has also been mentioned my guess is that they ' ll take niedermayer they may take pronger except that they already have too many defensive prospects .

i re read what i wrote and it did n ' t say exactly what i thought sure the pens are a better team they ' ve got size and the best skill players in the league they ' ve also got the best clutch goaltending they ' re the best team in the league but my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the pens since last year ' s choke and that ' s the mental problem the one they ' ve had for a number of years i tried to point out spirit mental preparedness will to win whatever you want to call it it ' s missing when the caps play the pens actually you ' re right it wo n ' t make any difference .
re eric true but fortunately we did n ' t get to find out what they would be like without recchi for qqq games soderstrom absolutely qqq shutouts in qqq games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him runnerups to galley and fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best but galley thinks he ' s paul coffey puts scoring ahead of defending and fedyk has tailed off big time eklund was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries qqq points in qqq games is not bad at all and recently he ' s been a huge factor in the wins they ' ve gotten eklund has never had a point a game season in his career his production is very typical for him how does he qualify as a disappointment if anything he ' s a surprise my choice would be roussel if i went strictly by what was expected of players but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a qqq goalie my biggest disappointment is bill dineen i thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team instead he ' s made too many bad moves and imho has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year any coach that thinks putting eric lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school .
the leafs have always been kind of comical during the second imlach era when darryl sittler was called a cancer on the team he tore the c off his sweater and for a while the leafs did n ' t have a captain sittler eventually ended up in philly and he was promised the philly captaincy by new gm and sittler ' s friend bobby clarke instead sittler got traded to detroit rick vaive was the leaf captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him then he was traded to chicago during doug carpenter ' s tenure as leaf coach in an attempt to kiss the ass of a sulking gary leeman the leafs took the a away from brad marsh to give to leeman leeman would n ' t take it and when they tried to give it back to marsh he would n ' t take it neither the best story i remember about a captain concerned mel bridgman late of the senators while he was in philadelphia bobby clarke arguably one of the great captains of all time was bumped up to the status of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy bridgman be came the new captain a reporter asked a flyer what bridgman did as a captain since clarke was still the undisputed leader amongst the players the reporter was told that bridgman was in charge of making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full -

the only problem is dave kingman was always taking off rosh hashana yom kippur easter the day elvis died qqq the entire spring training month of ramadan purim the qqq of july both games that day my birthday ok during the world series he never had to play there memorial day both games that day guys help me out here i ' ve run fresh out of holidays that coincide with the baseball season and i ' m trying to catalogue all the days in his career that dave kingman or at least his bat went awol a complete religious calendar detailing every holiday in every extant religion in the western hemisphere would be appreciated only then can we truly be certain that dave kingman observed every holiday ever conceived of course not !
alright that ' s enough i ' ve suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over qqq and you guys are complaining that he is n ' t drawing enough walks what would he have to do to please you guys bat qqq you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he is n ' t taking enough pitches my comment that he is n ' t paid to walk does n ' t mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs it ' s more along the lines of he ' s batting qqq and leading the league in rbi ' s so what bloody difference does it make if he is n ' t drawing a lot of walks sheesh .

who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the rangers hint nolan ryan is n ' t either what two pitchers have over qqq career saves for two different teams who is the only player to hit qqq or more career home runs and steal qqq or more career bases for the same team no fair peeking at your baseball stats .
this is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire aim i am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only do n ' t understand but publicly admit to not understanding in fact there ' s a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins for the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either qqq have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck qqq have pitched at least three innings effectively a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not saves this again does n ' t support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com

this comes indirectly from al morgani who works in the studio for espn hockey the management of espn was reluctant to leave the pitt nj game even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the wash ny game going to overtime when the caps scored with qqq left to tie the game al said he heard many people say f * k espn is under contractual obligation to show baseball and could not broadcast the ot of the hockey game next year qqq will be introduced so baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey get off espn ' s back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many f * n complainers about this game that it ' s making me sick .
make sure to take the sutcliff fisk ect factor into account .

i think dean got hit by a pitched ball the other night he got pinch hit for and did n ' t play against baltimore tonight what s up with that is he hurt please tell me he ' s not he evidentally got hit in the elbow by a fernando pitch his arm swelled from the elbow to the wrist or something like that they took x rays of the arm and there is nothing damaged he missed the last game with the orioles but he is suppose to be ready for the next game hope this helps .

disclaimer this is for fun in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort using the qqq defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri i ' ve figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders hits stolen have been redefined as plays kevin bass would not have made ok i realize that ' s unfair kevin ' s probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor but let ' s put it this way if we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin ' s qqq out making ability how many extra hits would go by to try and correlate it to reality a little more i ' ve calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make by the same method i ' ve calculated net extra bases doubles and triples let by finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense onbase plus slug which should represent the player ' s total contribution to the team so do n ' t take it too seriously the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article the short version definition of terms hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented as a rate dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player ' s total contribution national league name hs nhs neb dcon dops gonzalez l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gilkey b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq clark g qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq alou m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bonds b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq may d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gant r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bass k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ordered by dops qqq bonds qqq gilkey qqq gonzalez qqq alou qqq clark qqq nl average qqq gant qqq may qqq bass american league name hs nhs neb dcon dops raines t qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq anderson b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq henderson r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq vaughn g qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gladden d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq hall m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq mack s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq polonia l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq mcreynolds k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maldanado c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reimer k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq order by dops qqq henderson qqq anderson qqq raines qqq mack qqq vaughn qqq hall qqq al average qqq maldanado qqq mcreynolds qqq gladden qqq reimer qqq polonia more discussion dcon formula nhs ndp / pa nhs ndp neb / ab why such a bizzare formula basically it ' s designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are factored into slg that ' s why i used pa and ab as the divisors for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base qqq dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic
so this year you had a game on scny a game on sca a game on espn and if the rangers had n ' t crashed and burned you would have had a game on msg what are you complaining about i seem to recall last year everyone complaining about sc coverage i even remember orioles games being shown in the dc area instead of hockey and what about when sc failed to show the conclusion of other games because its feature game was over sound familiar this year i ' m getting twice the coverage i can see all the caps games plus the games espn shows i think it ' s great that hockey is back on espn imho they ' re doing a great job especially considering the baseball contract they have to work around -
there was an article on jewish major leaguers in a recent issue of elysian fields what used to be the minnesota review of baseball as i recall it had an amazing amount of research with a long list of players and a large bibliography .
you might want to clarify the qqq game winning streak that pens streak is a playoff streak tied by the chicago blackhawks who had won qqq in a row until they met the pens in the finals last year the qqq game unbeaten so far is a regular season unbeaten streak but hey do n ' t take it personally i ' m a flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch but with a healthy lindros recchi brind ' amour and tommy soderstrom they ' ll be there next year by the way since the flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that terry carkner wo n ' t be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense .
i think that you are incorrect roger patrick smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types hence they did help build the league although they were not great players themselves i agree that a name is a name is a name and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea if we can get people in the arena door by being uncomplicated then let ' s do so once we have them they will realize what a great game hockey is and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game no i would not want to see a ballard division but to say that these owners are assholes hence all nhl management people are assholes would be fallacious conn smythe for example was a classy individual from what i have heard also is n ' t the point of professional hockey to make money for all those involved which would include the players what i think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult in the form of lesser recognition to injury less money than was deserved .
being a proud bu alumnus i ' d like to get a list of bu players in the nhl so i can keep an eye on their progress a lot of terriers are graduating this year so i hope to see them soon in the nhl if somebody could post or send me a list i ' d appreciate it please note if the player graduated from here or not .
april qqq qqq i am participating in an nl league that uses standard rotisserie rules except that the following catagories are used for position players lowest batting average strike outs caught stealing errors for pitchers losses blown saves higest era taters allowed this is the fifth year that i ' ve participated in this blowtisserie league last year i won the pennant due primarily to the fact that i had terrible pitching i would like to lower my batting average which is rather high because i do have jose offerman who made up for this by helping me lock first place in errors anyway someone offered andres gallaraga for bud black i can afford to give up bud black because i still have kyle abbott however i am afraid of andres actually doing well this season should i make the trade or not your comments will be appreciated warren usui
i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work i do n ' t remember why they said that it did not work anyone remember this jody mcdonnel on wip in phil has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable how would a pitch clock work on throws to first another pair of suggestions qqq remove the balk rule it is the runners responsibility to stay safe no matter what the pitcher does qqq if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x qqq to qqq without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base as if walked the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage the base walk allows the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base i too find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery .
if the leaf ' s play like they did in game one they ' re going to need these watching that game _ really _ hurt cheers i -
imo any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage very good power play scorers tend to become overrated because their point totals are inflated by power play points tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull john cullen and dave andreychuck given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can inflate his totals .

currently he ' s all over he played qqq when deshields was out he was shifted to third when delino came back and today he played ss for a cold wil cordero his natural positions seem to be in the middle infield but they will seemingly find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot .
hopefully a miracle o . k not quite a miracle but close will occur and pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals if they make it again they will probably keep the cup if they do n ' t it ' s the hawks turn go blackhawks congrats to jeremy roenick for being only the qqq hawks player to post back to back qqq goal seasons !
from this account it does n ' t sound like you even saw the goal mike smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the back of the leg fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened the puck went straight off fuhr ' s leg and into the net fuhr never had a chance there was no play back to the goaltender in fact perry berezan of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it it was unfortunate that it happened smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time and on his birthday too but all the blame lies with him starting in pee wee coaches tell players never to make a cross ice pass in front of their own net too much chance of having it intercepted or hitting the goaltender or whatever and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series i can only say that he certainly did n ' t cause the team to lose the other three games there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the qqq game of the second round everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation .
i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati this would help so that the o ' s could make some real free agent signings in the offseason training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent although i would prefer parent qqq draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming up faster in the o ' s hierarchy of the minors faster than expected mike flanagan is trying for another comeback big ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half this may be ben ' s year i feel that while this may not be mussina ' s cy young year he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around august i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o ' s need orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in qqq the o ' s right now do n ' t have many left handed hitters anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal ' s return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant the rotation should be sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes olson is an interesting case will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs you never know the way i see the al east this year with personal biases mixed in baltimore new york toronto milwaukee cleveland boston detroit the top qqq are the only true contenders in my mind one of these qqq will definitely win the division unless it snows in hell maryland i feel that this baltimore ' s season to finally put everything together _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ~
there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are that ' s bullshit anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers it ' s ok to follow and be concerned about your home team but to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan a true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team when i visit pittsburgh i ' ll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they could n ' t sign barry bonds lert ' s say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team i ' ll still follow it and bitch about it but i wo n ' t waste my money on mediocre teams .
on tuesday when it was raining in chicago espn provided bonus hockey coverage now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the ny wash ot was replaced with the angels game people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the u . s the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they ca n ' t skip the baseball game why do n ' t you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get .
i have tickets for the tb giants and i was wondering if anybody familiar with the stadium could tell me where section qqq in the lower level is located please e mail the response thanks rich
on the other hand i ' m hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes fereirra made imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of hindsight let ' s say that in the view of the sharks upper management the attempt to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra i ' m inclined to take exactly the opposite view they should have kept him he ' s obviously the luckiest man in hockey wonder what sacrifice he made to the muse of fax his job i guess have fun gak

my respect for the power of the hockey gods is preventing me from commenting on the above and for commenting on whether the guy damphousse was traded for is on vacation or not perhaps roger demonstrably in contempt of the hockey gods and paying for it dares a comment or two ?
but why mcgwire and not carter i can see some justification for bonds or thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major difference i see between mcgwire and carter is that carter does n ' t draw walks why are n ' t pitchers afraid to throw strikes to carter ?
oh yea and chris bosio pitched a no hitter one over the minimum two bases on ball in the first inning one runner left qqq pitches i listened to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a real treat as long as they keep ron fairly quite i doubt if anyone is better than niehaus but that fairly guy is really annoying me but i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching it would have been a different story two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in major league baseball pretty impressive in any league man if johnson bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year also john cummings rookie has had three solid outings with no support if fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year relief is another story though grimace too cool the first no hitter that i have been able to follow from start to end and again i think niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game the guy is truly a joy to listen to he deserves a pennant race .
what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could they have forced nylander to play in springfield ?
what did you leave the room each of the qqq or so times they said that there were no other night baseball games every break they took back at the studio mentioned it followed by so we ' re gon na show you hockey instead my wife and i are hoping for rain at every baseball game they have a feed for tommorrow night point is be glad they showed hockey but if baseball was available anywhere else you can bet you would ' ve watched baseball last night .
i have to disagree with you on this one it is anything but common in the qqq or qqq years i have been watching hockey i have never seen this happen ever i am not sure what league you have been watching anyone else agree with this ?
is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi ' s this is the situation that brought the question up the red sox were up in the bottom of the qqq by a score of qqq qqq the mariners had the bases loaded with qqq out the batter hits a fly to center which the fielder catches the runner at third tags and scores without a throw now without a judgement call and i do n ' t think there is one this is an rbi for the batter it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive indifference since it does n ' t really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point i know i can think of several if the mariners stole third and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third he would n ' t have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore ca n ' t make the throw to first to get the last out etc scenarios too but does it _ really _ matter if this guy scores this way when you ' re down by qqq if the tying run is going to score so is the guy on third the point is that the batter imo should n ' t get credit an rbi for utterly failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one run what do you guys think ?

jagr has a higher but francis has had more points and take it from an informed observer ronnie francis has had a much better season than jaromir jagr this is not to take anything away from jaro who had a decent year although it did n ' t live up to the expectations of some bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style player he plays hard at all times does n ' t disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject i am pretty sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis when you add to that jagr ' s better rating i think it becomes evident that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one actually what i think has become more evident is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all cost jagr did not have a better season than francis to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i . e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team ' s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications thank you for posting this as the person who first brought up the fact that jagr has a much higher than francis i can assure you that i brought it up as an example of the absurdity of comparisons even on the same team i never ever thought that anyone would argue that jagr ' s higher actually reflected better two way play in my opinion francis ' s low is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he can chip in qqq points while neutralizing the other team ' s top center is a testament to how valuable he is even if his suffers on the other hand jagr for how big fast and skilled he is ca n ' t even get qqq points no matter how inflated his is by the way do n ' t get me wrong i like jagr he may be a lazy floater but he turns it on at exactly the right times like overtime of playoff games .
i totally agree with each point you made jose viscaino looked like a single a hitter up there who swings on qqq qqq count with maddux pitching and your teams down by a run and you have n ' t touched the ball all day i also think too much is made of that lefty righty thing watching the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about what the cubs should be doing than lefebre does harry said it best when he stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat we ca n ' t wait til sandberg returns !

in detroit the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league in the era of the original qqq four teams made the playoffs to win the cup a team had to win two seven game series in other words it took qqq playoff wins to win the cup the octopus qqq legs has become a common detroit symbol every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus octopi into the joe louis arena and throwing them onto the ice .
there are very few disciplines where qqq certainty is necessary to state something as fact baseball is not one of them therefore i can say that i know clemens was better than morris last year and larkin was better than griffin no i ca n ' t ascertain this i ca n ' t prove it but i ' m not required to do so and since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless why do n ' t you simply stay out of them ?
funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks which are nothing but collections of statistics are authored by bill james and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook and i am not sure how the qqq bill james player ratings book qualifies as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue finally the point was not about the word statistics it was about money grubbing i do n ' t see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book can not consider him money grubbing .

that ' s not inner calm it ' s boredom and it ' s being spoiled the arena ' s been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted it ' s been seemingly forever since the team lost and we ' ve forgotten what it ' s like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory at least last night there was some excitement the pens did n ' t have it wrapped up before the game was half over like the previous two games i ' m not sure if nj just rose up and played better or if the penguins just started to play down somewhat probably it was somewhere in between new jersey seemed much more aggressive last night in the pens end they did much more swarming around which at least kept an element of suspense in the game no question that billington helped make it more interesting also claude lemieux did n ' t help the cause any though with his ejection early in the game so who ' s going to start in the devils goal for the final game sunday sorry i could n ' t help myself .

i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it qqq rob zettler season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade c c zettler gave the sharks every bit he ' s got this year unfortunately this still was n ' t enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that he works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero qqq goal and qqq assists in qqq games he would be hardpressed to make the team next year qqq david williams season qqq acquired qqq qqq free agent from new jersey grade c c imo williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in qqq qqq playing a combination of good offense qqq goals and qqq assists in qqq games and good defense but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that qqq qqq was a fluke although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team ' s leading scorer among defensemen last year he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year qqq jayson more season qqq acquired qqq qqq from montreal in expansion draft grade b after being touted as the team ' s top defensive prospects in training camp before qqq qqq more had a rather disappointing qqq qqq as he was not particularly good defensively and had just qqq points in qqq games he then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the team ' s most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he was even more disappointing than last year qqq points in qqq games but his defense improved tremendously he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman qqq neil wilkinson season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b wilkinson was probably the team ' s top defensive defenseman in qqq qqq however partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed qqq games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is if they are there at all but he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force qqq sandis ozolinsh season qqq acquired qqq qqq qqq round pick in entry draft grade i a at the time of his injury december qqq against the philadelphia flyers ozolinsh was well on track to be imo the team ' s mvp a serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season qqq games but he still finished as the team ' s top scorer among defensemen qqq points which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinsh ' s abilities at the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to so called rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran if he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star qqq doug zmolek season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks to play in all qqq games of the season he was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he did n ' t show it qqq points he was also prone to penalties and his qqq penalty minutes was second on the team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically but to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents .

i loved dan kelly he was on usa when i first got hooked on hockey back in qqq or so no he was n ' t always spot on top of the play and he was n ' t overly cute but those pipes that lusty barrel chested voice no pipsqueak was he unlike some fellas we know i rode into hockey mania on the coattails of gretzky and the boys on the bus my first finals saw the islanders sweep them but i ' ll never forget the night a year later when the oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium the smoke from a million sparklers the long empty net goal near the end and dan kelly letting the crowd ' s reaction tell the story for a few long seconds then that voice barking through the din dave lumley sews it up for edmonton it sounds stupid but that early for me hockey memory will always bring a thrill since then i ' ve grown a lot more jaded about the game but i was really saddened by dan kelly ' s passing he was one of the good guys .
nah let ' s reserve rec . sports . idiots for people who post obvious flamebait like yourself if someone posts something as controversial not to mention idiotic as what austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup someone should challenge the statement there is a school of thought that suggests that silence consent whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly should apply to a forum of public discussion which r . s . b is if you ' ve been reading r . s . b lately you ' ll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings alibet in an edited form it ' s making me think a little more carefully about some of the things i post in conclusion if someone like austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that i do n ' t read fine he ' s got the right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name of free speech but if he drools in a newsgroup that i read then i will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his drooling now of course you do n ' t have to read any of this and if you want to cut down on flames then don ' t post flamebait you do n ' t have to respond to flames either saves cyberspace )
my votes fwiw team mvp pat verbeek he fans on qqq of goal mouth feeds but he still has qqq goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons honorable mention nick kypreos and mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than mvp but kypreos qqq goals qqq pim has been the hardest working player on the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker i guess i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had qqq goals and qqq points last season as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up qqq goals and qqq points he now has a new whaler record qqq power play goals most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but cassels is just qqq and will score close to qqq points this season he has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still qqq and will put up about qqq goals and qqq points this season yake like sanderson started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the right side biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had a disasterous qqq point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen started the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it cullen scored just qqq point on qqq games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded the powerplay to a qqq success percentage qqq with sanderson and sulked his way out of town worst of all his qqq year qqq m contract had three years left to run so no one would give up any more than the qqq round draft pick the maple leafs offered to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar after signing a qqq year qqq m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes of competence but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo who only seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row .
if life were so simple savard has not played in three of the last four games and they are still playing like crap montreal ' s problems run deeper than savard and mouton unfortunately i hope they can get their act together before the playoffs the line up in their game coming up against pittsburgh is said to be the one they ' re likely to use for the playoffs let ' s hope they can forget about the nice weather we ' re having and play hockey .

note i ' m not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independent sort of thread i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as sampling his post in the hip hop sense because it fits in with what i want to say there ' s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people ' s conception of a biological organism in the biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of the game and organisms for teams how we interpret players is trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make a genes interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case but that would be a different and probably longer post if however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z given what we know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious of such claims but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map species x onto humans and organ z onto brain on the other hand some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others as far as we can test them e . g brain above might be more reasonable than pancreas assuming no gross pathology particularly if species y is a primate even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species however if we are non vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable some of these processes might be localized to particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple organs in a way this is just like a baseball team except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do but of course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research in this cases we ' re seeing the word statistics means summary of observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment you might be fit in one situation and not another moving to baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league in at least a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts but in a real sense there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to or interesting for baseball the same is true in biology but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal in the world series the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful it might be fun to watch but it ' s unclear what it all really means now just one more un related point on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes and maybe some of us e . g me who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis but this is probably only due to the fact that a qqq schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops are n ' t the only difference between the winners and the losers moreover you ' ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well known home vs road effect on winning percentage since stats are summaries of events it ' s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful speaking of which i should get back to producing knowledge in a different field that is of course if i can produce knowledge even though i ' m relying on stats to do it .

well it ' s not that bad but i am still pretty pissed of at the local abc coverage they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing david brinkley at qqq instead of an earlier time slot i do n ' t even understand their problem if they did nt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game and if they showed the remaining qqq hours of the game would it hurt to play david brinkley at its regular time they do nt have any decent programming before noon anyway i called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine i called gain and someone picked it up when i asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the stanley cup playoffs he seemed a bit confused when i explained a bit more in detail he then said that ' s upto to our programming dept call back on monday weel i understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption but i ca n ' t understand how someone in the sports dept ca n ' t even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for anyway i am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again i urge all atlanta hockey fans to call wsb qqq and ask them not to do the same thing for the next qqq weeks .

if i remember correctly which is always in doubt horner ' s signing with the braves was contingent on starting in atlanta i think he could have gone back to arizona st for one more year if he had n ' t signed anyhow the braves did try to send him to richmond once it lead to a week long walkout methinks horner had no work ethic before he was drafted and minor league play would n ' t have helped but his raw talent would have gotten him into the ml and it did keep him there for a while until he started falling on his wrists .
that ' s might be what it takes to beat the braves this year .

please have a care with phil we liked him a lot in pittsburgh he did n ' t score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his butt off it was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive zone that allowed the pens to utilize his potential i have n ' t been paying attention to him this year so i ca n ' t say i know what you ' re objecting to he has been out with injuries though has n ' t he and if the offense is n ' t there there ' s not much his speed will do for you like i said he created opportunities but he did n ' t score much i thought the money offered from the rangers was a little high and so did the pens i guess joseph stiehm please have a care with phil we liked him a lot in pittsburgh he did n ' t score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his butt off it was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive zone that allowed the pens to utilize his potential i have n ' t been paying attention to him this year so i ca n ' t say i know what you ' re objecting to he has been out with injuries though has n ' t he and if the offense is n ' t there there ' s not much his speed will do for you like i said he created opportunities but he did n ' t score much i thought the money offered from the rangers was a little high and so did the pens i guess .

if my powerplay was as bad as montreal ' s i ' d be thanking stewart for calling as few penalties as possible quebec ' s powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay montreal really lost that game and game qqq because patrick roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs the man is truly overrated quebec has scored six goals on roy and four perhaps five were quite stoppable .

yes but as has been mentioned many times before the islanders play at the talent level of their opponent since hartford is pitiful the islanders played pitiful since pittsburgh is great the isles will most likely play great this is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting to greg yes i have noticed that the islanders could n ' t hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it does anyone have shooting percentages i do n ' t know if that would help since they often miss the net completely but it might shed some light on the subject and my playoff pool is running exact rules to be posted tomorrow but do n ' t hesitate to send in picks keith keller let ' s go rangers let ' s go quakers kkeller @ mail . sas . upenn . edu ivy league champs !

there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano who was gm before murray what the previous gm also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory murray craven who had a few very good years with philly after leaving here also it ' s not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team but the quality of them trading adam oates for bernie federko was just plain stupid even if federko used to be a great player at one time most of murray ' s trades have worked significantly to the wings advantage with those that did n ' t being soured mainly by injury to the players involved such as troy crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered put scotty bowman pat burns or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this detroit team and they could beat anybody .

cardinals for poor without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war i would like to question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real effect on his long term performance sure if a man is tired and needs real rest then taking a break might be a constructive act perhaps if a man is mentally strained then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax but i would like to suggest that in the long run players do slump and benching is probably irrelevant .
alomar fans left rbi fans and runs off this list because they are dependant on the team to a large extent if frank thomas hit first he ' d lose a lot of rbi ' s and anyways how many qqq place hitters have you known to drive in qqq runs does n ' t happen that often very unlikely with devon white ' s qqq obp in front of you .
pierre for purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in each city therefore quebec can not possibly be ahead of montreal qqq qqq and there ' s probably only one game that counts remaining between boston and quebec which means boston has probably already won .
does anyone have the player stats for games played up until april qqq .
the french canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a few years and really did n ' t have any substantial effect during that period the canadiens stanley cup achievements were earned on a level playing field .
well what do you expect burns was playing him with krushelnyski and baumgartner anderson is a finisher unless you play him with someone to can get him the puck in a finishing position he ai n ' t going to do much scoring !
i do n ' t actually have the answer to this one bosio after walking the first two batters retired qqq for a back end perfect game how many other games including extra inning games have seen a pitcher retire qqq straight excluding official perfect games the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first batter walk shore picked him off and retired qqq straight after that matt wall wall @ cc . swarthmore . edu hey i got ta job here ok ?

buck showalter just ca n ' t win bob wickman ' s pitching the game of his life through eight innings yanks lead qqq qqq so buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game wickman manages to get two outs but in between four funs score and all of a sudden it ' s qqq qqq and wickman just ca n ' t get the third out so buck goes to the bullpen and farr gets out the first guy he faces last night jimmy key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life this guy just keeps getting better through eight innings yanks lead qqq qqq this time buck thinks i do n ' t want a repeat of that near fiasco with wickman so i ' ll give my bullpen some work steve howe whose era was qqq coming into the game left with it at qqq he did n ' t do too good then farr comes in he gives up a two run homer and the royals win it qqq qqq what ' s going on this is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead farr howe have done it twice together monteleone ' s done it once and i think even habyan did it once what ' s the deal we finally have terrific starting pitching so all of a sudden our bullpen turns to shit what ' s buck gon na do and what ' s george gon na do if this continues to happen ?
i ' ll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted for most career k ' s with one team if it ' s not ryan perhaps steve carlton with the rangers hough was there for a long time in the qqq saves department maybe lee smith ( he should have at least a hundred with the cubbies maybe enough with either the rsox or cards then maybe gossage ( nyy and sd fingers mil oak do n ' t know about the homers steals dept in some other article ( mets trivia it could be tim leary in at least the losing to all teams maybe beating all of ' em too probably seaver and koosman fit too and in randy johnson ' s no hitter i think it was scott bradley the other half of the old mariner catching platoon who was behind the plate that night .
bobby bonilla supposedly use the word faggot when he got mad at that author in the clubhouse should he be banned from baseball for a year like schott ?

i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne clement i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me i was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the coverage i was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting back to the puck boy everyone has been ripping on espn ' s hockey coverage or is it just pittsburgher ' s who are thrilled with lange steigy for all of you who are unaware espn bought the air time from abc and did all the production advertising sales commentating etc and even reaped any made .
well i agree that if you ' re going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at in general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises however there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player felix potvin imo crossed that line on wednesday that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that it showed an immaturity he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in instead he slashed in an attempt to injure it was out of shear frustration as a leaf supporter just a supporter i ' m not a leaf fan really i was very disappointed you ' re right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans and players disliked them that ' s why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues let ' s hope that felix does n ' t do that again i ' d hate to see anyone even dino although i admit i do n ' t like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick .
well i ' m finally about to key in the official rules for the archives but before i do i will ask again does anybody have the official mlb rules in electronic format just trying to save myself a ton of work no they do n ' t scan well because of the ridiculous format they ' re printed in thanks matt matt wall wall @ cc . swarthmore . edu hey i got ta job here ok ?

you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the nhl there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players bobby clarke kenny linsemen pie mckenzie chris chelios etc but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like should have been a women samuelson do n ' t belong when players like ulf who ' s main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league wo n ' t stop it the players should a christian pro qqq aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future you can bet neely will have his day the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a stanely cup this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup the penguins would not even notice he ' s gone he ' s an eyesore on the game of hockey rich thank you for your extremely lucid and well thought out observation now when you get back on your medication please let us know how you are feeling thank you ,

here is a press release from the white house remarks by president clinton to ncaa division i champion hockey team april qqq q & a following to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary qqq qqq qqq washington april qqq following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black bears ncaa division i hockey champions the rose garden qqq a . m edt the president good morning ladies and gentlemen it ' s an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship and we ' re glad to have them here i ' m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in qqq i ' m sure that qqq years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey we do n ' t have a lot of ice laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here hockey is a tough game it ' s a hard hitting sport it does have one virtue though there ' s a penalty for delay of game i wish we had that rule in the senate laughter in government as in hockey leadership is important in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator cohen looks so young i ca n ' t imagine laughter i ' m actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a come from behind victory something else i know a little bit about sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind i think it ' s important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives we now have another role model and i ' m glad to have them here today applause the president is presented with team jersey applause the president that ' s great i love it it ' s beautiful applause the president is presented with an autographed stick the president thank you that ' s great applause q mr president did you authorize the move on waco this morning sir the president i was aware of it i think the attorney general made the decision and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi q did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed the president no they made the tactical decisions that was their judgment the fbi q is this a raid the president and i will i want to refer you to talk to the attorney general and the fbi i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning q any chance for that stimulus package the president senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter laughter i was in there laughter senator mitchell you have to pay that quarter the president i was ready laughter senator mitchell he ' s worth a quarter any day q any chance for your bill sir the president we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings we ' re going to have for the rest of the week we only had about five minutes to talk and we agreed we ' d get back together later around noon and talk some more q senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise the president well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in qqq and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of qqq emergency spending measures totalling over qqq billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work i do n ' t want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it you can look at the research there so this position they ' re taking is not credible we have a very tough five year deficit reduction plan all these costs are covered during that time and then some and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for do n ' t have much of a history on which to base their position they ' ve got qqq years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work so i think we ' ve got a chance to work it out and i ' m hopeful we ' ll see what happens today and tomorrow i ' m feeling pretty good about it the press thank you end qqq a . m edt qqq

dallas helps hawks stay in moncton after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of moncton the winnipeg jets changed their mind the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from qqq to around a dozen and they wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise enter the dallas lone stars dallas agreed to supply the remaining qqq or qqq players to the moncton franchise thus keeping the hawks in the new brunswick city the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over qqq the hawks only sold qqq for this year saint john flames official the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of saint john nb the saint john blue flames will play in the qqq exhibition center the flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble caps follow jacks to maine despite rumors to the contrary the capitals will follow the baltimore skipjacks to maine the caps current farm team the baltimore skipjacks announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with portland they would supply a dozen or so players including qqq goalies they become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders .

and it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent people in rec . sport . hockey her sole purpose in mentioning the net as steve gallichio has already pointed out is to lend weight to her points through association with the internet there is no other reason to mention the internet this is misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation alison would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits this is not a letter it is a petition claiming to represent a large proportion of rec . sport . hockey users and by implication a significant number of internet users qqq names can in no way be considered a large proportion of rec . sport . hockey which while we have no way of counting actual readership is accessible to hundreds of thousands of people qqq persons is no more than a fly ' s fart in a windstorm gee you looked up large in the dictionary what next two syllable words let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of qqq is when you are looking for ways to beef up your iq scores as i said he might be impressed by the size of the list of names but it would have to be considerably larger but even this definition does not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence well then what the hell is your point you do n ' t really know if you have an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you do n ' t like me is that it -
i ' m sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by rookie j . t snow of the california angeles other than the fact that his father was a star receiver with the l . a rams and is now a radio personality in los angeles and j . t came from the yankees organization i do n ' t know much about j . t if anyone has info and background on the young fenom please post by the way for those of you not following his exploits he has hit four home runs in three days two last night he has also delivered the winning hit a couple of times for the angeles in this young season thanks .
i wonder why you say that i do n ' t see why having a spouse and / or kids would have anything to do with it it might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour in which case i ' d probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends as many people do or else be prepared to leave the game early but from what you say later on you do n ' t bring your kids or your spouse to the game as it happens i have a husband but no kids and my husband usually attends games with me i can see it ' s a problem if you do n ' t bring your wife to the ballgame but that ' s a problem even if the game goes a trim qqq qqq hours as far as bagging work the next day i do n ' t really understand why that ' s necessary unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer i note that this is the case for many guys if you do n ' t think you can get up to go to work after a long evening out then do n ' t have long evenings out during the week look if i pay between qqq and qqq apiece for tickets plus qqq for parking plus spending my time and energy driving to and from boston plus spending additional money on concessions etc at the ballpark then i see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money i ca n ' t afford to go to a lot of games hence going to a game is a big deal like going to a play or an opera maybe you have more money than i do and can go to games all year long so it ' s not such a big deal for you but i ' m not interested in having games sped up any more than i want to have _ die walkure _ cut down to a convenient weeknight version of two hours if i felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere with my family life or my work life then i ' d choose to go to a weekend game impo .
i would be veru interested also if there is one could someone please send me some info ?
well obp is the most important offensive statistic and by a big margin qqq points of obp is worth considerably more than qqq points of slugging that being said i still think baerga was very slightly better last year but i think this is as close to a wash as you ' re likely to find i personally do n ' t care much for alomar ' s defense i do n ' t think he ' s nearly as good as people make him out to be and he ca n ' t turn the dp to save his life he comes across the bag improperly and his release is slow considering the high leverage of the dp this is a shortcoming i ca n ' t overlook in the long term i ' d move alomar to another position if the jays could trade a hot devon white for something i ' ll be alomar could be a hell of a cf in the long run i think i ' d rather have jeff kent at qqq and alomar in cf than alomar white .
it is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability the critic invariably makes a mistake himself english is generally written english oddly i do not see that i have contested any of that perhaps you with assuredly greater english ability can explain in tiny words that i might grasp their meaning precisely where i infer that you have said any of those things no mr fisher you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the allegation in the first place you do not perhaps you might explain why that is as for the email route mr fisher you might have tried that yourself .
during the local rockies broadcast the other day don baylor went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up on the screen that it was the so and so sponsored pitching change i saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored at other times during the game rockies announcer duane kuiper was setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation that charlie jones would jump in and discuss the situation but what does charlie do he read ' s a beer advertisement and leaves duane hanging duane ' s strategy proved prophetic these examples happen over and over on radio and t . v braodcasts making them sometimes very boring to listen to i guess it ' s just a matter of time before a player sells his name to budweiser nike etc i do n ' t think it will be long until we hear nike budweiser drills it deep to left field chevrolet goes back back it ' s gone the apple macintoshes formerly the boston red sox are the qqq world champions back to work anthony m jivoin national center for atmospheric research rsf atd qqq p . o box qqq boulder co qqq

and fleury is no enforcer an agitator for sure but fleury never has and never will have a fight which seems to be what you ' re saying wood is the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against los angeles there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleury ' s head under his arm fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the head mcsorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped fleury one right between the eyes end of fight fleury got ten stitches for his trouble the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning and even then he ' d be giving up two inches and qqq qqq pounds )
i ' m personally expecting moog blue played fairly decent alright spectacular at times in his qqq a game but moog has the experience what did blue have going for him nothing what would happen in a tie game the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out at the very least until your team scores blue did n ' t face that kind of pressure on tuesday the bruins will come out storming that is for sure i really think that this series is up to buffalo boston except for two bad passes in game one really has n ' t played that bad as a believer is statistics you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later just keep shooting there game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first and control the tempo imho pat ellis p . s go bruins go umaine black bears qqq qqq qqq number qqq hockey east regulars season champions hockey east tournament champions paul kariya hobey baker award winner ncaa div qqq hockey tournament champions !

mcgill hammond johan garpenlov would you really rather have those two instead of johan by your logic then you enjoy having falloon and ozolinsh on injured reserve falloon was hurt on a clean check he just fell poorly same with wilson i do n ' t know about ozolinsh a judo coach would do more for the sharks injury situation than bob probert actually a judo ju jitsu coach could help add a really interesting wrinkle to anyone ' s game .
ok the mets and o ' s are good examples but what about the qqq reds do you really think that anyone expected them to sweep the a ' s i know people who did n ' t even think they ' d win a game let alone win the series we proved them wrong though did n ' t we as for this year ignore their record now they ' ve had a rocky start and that has nothing to do with colorado they shall rise again the hunt for a reds october continues with all due respect to wlw bye .
well as a hockey fan i think it ' s terrible it ' s one thing to say hey let ' s give a hockey team to cities that do n ' t have one that ' s fine it ' s entirely another to say okay let ' s take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but from what i know a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining qqq season tickets to get to the qqq level that green wanted yet he refused every time it ' s pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and the fans were great people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have sro and the whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific minnesota is hockey usa how the nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond me i only hope they get a new team soon just my qqq ali .

welcome aboard and since i have n ' t seen this yet this year but all preceding years let me say :
quite honestly this one is ridiculous consider the following scenario runner on third as the pitcher starts to throw home the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze the pitcher seeing this does not throw home but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down it is the balk rule that prevents this from happening believe it or not this actually happened to me once in an oba ontario baseball association game in milton ontario i was the batter and to my amazement the umpire missed it in the qqq years that i played ball this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw .

quebec dominated habs for first qqq periods and only roy kept this one from being rout although he did blow qqq goal canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump pull back most of the time hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored qqq could have had qqq plus another qqq in qqq canadians are dead meat they may take one or qqq but this one is over tee it up jacques next time you might rest players forget about qqq place welcome to the adams division .

need i say more ?
if i ' m not mistaken san jose had more wins than ottawa first tiebreaker in the nhl is always most wins .
strictly from memory i think the phillies were something like ten games up with qqq to go lost qqq in a row and qqq of last qqq to lose to the cardinals seems impossible but that s how i remember it i also felt at the time that johnny callison of the phillies lost the mvp as a by product of their swoon jerry
devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display by maclean the canucks tied up the jets so tightly that i thought that they were mailing them btw greg next time do n ' t fall asleep in geography class it ' s pretty sad when a fellow in norway can spell winnipeg properly and a guy in north america ca n ' t one more thing how long has vancouver been in the nhl how many championships do they have oh yeah and i can go to the arena and see not one not two but six championship banners hanging from the rafters qqq stanley cup banners and qqq avco cup banners my nhl guide says that vancouver has won the cup once as many times as the rockin town of kenora has won it )
with all the recent problems the indians have been having with their pitching staff i have heard numerous names thrown around about who could solve their problem one name i have not heard is mike soper rp as far as i know soper has had pretty good minor league stats why not give the kid a chance anyone know anything about this guy -
the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year with mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth the tiger bats will bang this summer already they have scored qqq runs in two games and with fielder tettleton and deer i think they can win the division no pitching bull gully moore wells and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games then there is henneman to close it out watch out boston toronto and baltimore the motor city kittys are back .
interesting one of our german friends here robert told me their forwards were all canadian germans perhaps somebody can sort this out for us ok this ai n ' t north america and so on but i still doubt that _ any _ city having a pop of qqq and below could support an nhl team of course switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small distances between cities but still dusseldorf yes although the arena is an anachronism an open wall behind one of the goals essentially an outdoor arena cologne ' s arena only seats about qqq qqq berlin is about qqq and no new facility will be built unless their olympic bid is successful munich does have an arena malmo is big enough but they also need a new arena the current one has qqq seats i think if we ' re talking about the nhl even helsinki would struggle to make it work turku despite an excellent arena and tampere are nowhere near big enough for major league hockey rome and the south are out of the question this could as well be africa to hockey fans romans were given the chance to host some qqq games but showed no interest whatsoever all teams in the italian league come from milan and the smaller cities in the north paris had their own volans francais ( sp pro team a couple of years ago i believe they even made it to the european club championship finals tournament one year but eventually folded due to lower than hoped for attendances the remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor sport like hockey the easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey perhaps most european teams will have to be like the tampa bay lightning anyway playing in a small qqq seat arena backed by japanese money run by enthusiasts phil esposito heavy marketing fans that have difficulty telling what icing means london has been mentioned sheffield and birmingham also have large arenas and a new mega facility qqq seats might be built in bristol in a couple of years no facilities to speak of their biggest arena in eindhoven seats qqq fans for hockey .

i think murray has done a great job he ' s picked up ciccarelli sheppard ysebaert howe coffey and riendeau plus some depth players without giving up anything the wings needed or any of his top prospects all of this in three years has anyone done better the year before he took over the wings did n ' t even make the playoffs there was about a year and a half during demers stint that the wings did ok but that was due to demers motavational skills and clutch and grab style they did n ' t have much talent gerald murray was n ' t responsible for primeau although i ' m not ready to admit that ' s a horrible pick they hired him after the draft which has never made sense to me his first pick was lapointe ron

i do n ' t notice refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around and yes i have to agree that stewart called the two worst games i ' ve seen so far mtl quebec game qqq and last nights toronto detroit game what ' s the scoop on this guy is he the latest incarnation of kerry fraser just because you are boneheadedly stubborn does n ' t make you a good ref making the right call does my votes for best ref van hellemond most improved koharski worst paul stewart oops i do n ' t really want to start a best worst ref thread so do n ' t follow up )

true rumor fact a big three way deal eric lindros going to ottawa senators and senators get qqq from montreal montreal gets alexander daigle the first round pick from senators philly gets damphousse bellow patrick roy and a draft pick .
did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason given for this also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview on qqq rickey henderson became nolan ' s qqq strikeout on qqq he pitched his qqq no hitter against oakland i believe the last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on qqq nolan pitched his qqq no hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his qqq base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of publicity at rickey ' s expense imo rickey deserves it and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what i ' ve seen on it lately they are both great players but imo nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts .
you have n ' t been facing major league pitching maybe more you have to be good at the plate and most stats did a little study in the qqq scoreboard book entitled can you hit sacrifice flies on purpose a summary of the findings over the qqq year period sac fly type fly balls were produced qqq percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful and qqq percent of the time when a sac fly was n ' t useful they looked at the leaders in sac flies and found that the leaders in sac flies in other words the guys you would expect to be good at it it hit sac fly type fly balls only qqq more often when they needed to a difference way too small to be the result of a skill essentially the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often with and without a runner on third stats concludes so it appears conclusive that hitters can not hit sacrifice flies on purpose even if they practice in the batting cage "
i think the next time i post something like this i obviously need to make the sarcasm a bit more obvious chuck

is there any doubt that this is true after a few down years the a . l east is back to where it was in the early eighties with the emergence of the o ' s and the yanks it is far and away the best while the n . l west has the best team in baseball and the reds are n ' t bad either they have nothing else the giants astros and padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the a . l east and the dodgers just plain suck as for the rockies who knows the a . l east has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to free agency toronto is still one of the best in baseball the orioles have the preseason favorite to win the cy young in mike mussina and you can never forget about ripken the signings of harold baines and harold reynolds do n ' t hurt to much either although i always liked bill ripken while they let a lot go this summer randy milligan joe orsulak bill ripken bob milacki sam horn storm davis and craig lefferts they kept the heart of their team intact my predicted finish qqq baltimore could be a biased opinion qqq ny yankees qqq toronto qqq milwaukee qqq detroit qqq boston qqq cleveland would have been higher if not for the accident go o ' s !
lou wanted morris all along the idiot giving the man qqq million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away i do n ' t see why people expect boston to finish sixth the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied boston in seventh place had qqq wins the yankees and indians tied for fourth place had qqq wins now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers basically the red sox are stronger this year at qqq dh ss lf and rf they have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better relievers i see no reason why they should n ' t win qqq games meanwhile the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching they will win some qqq qqq blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of qqq qqq games too maybe the sox will play poorly win qqq games and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place is more likely .

quoted for future reference he believed one of two things qqq sabo was more likely than samuel to get a hit or qqq that more good would be done in the long run by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome in fact you do n ' t know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in in fact i do n ' t think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event but we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue i think seeing insults in other people ' s opinions is kind of silly after all mark did n ' t call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it did n ' t change his opinion on the subject if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has and mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way at some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every monday night maybe he sees his sports shrink on tuesday mornings or has his vitamin b shots monday nights but this is something that ' s true of one guy only it does n ' t mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be but it does n ' t mean we ca n ' t make predictions based on that for that particular player i only see a prediction for one player here i do n ' t see anything about all batters that ' s exactly what mark is trying to do though find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance huh what does gambler ' s fallacy have to do with anything whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you ca n ' t deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you do n ' t think it is likely to continue to exist because you ca n ' t see a reason for it to exist someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate the argument along the lines of star player with l r splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game i . e opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a ph what about you if the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind ?

we have no way of knowing because we can not separate morris contribu tion from the rest of the team ' s there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball and that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game each game determines which team is the best that day at the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division the playoffs determine the best of the best but the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams not the individual players there is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely that player a ' s team would have played better with player b in their lineup sheer speculation impossible to ascertain if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then fine but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual ' s contribution to winning the ws because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base ball so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub jective and is mere opinion i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon exactly the jays won with morris pitching and boston wins with clemens pitching i am not saying that morris is better than clemens i am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that clemens is better based on his era has missed the point of what baseball is all about you do n ' t have to be rude for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy ignoratio elenchi i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings although i have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual ' s performance from that of his team ' s for the purpose of comparing that individual ' s performance with another individual ' s per formance the stats are a nice hobby and that ' s about it there is no new knowledge being produced so when a poster claims that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds -
well sherri i ' d agree with you except that most kiddies have more sense than to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults i try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use computers but i ' m telling you it ' s gotten to the point that i do n ' t even edit the files anymore just read them and throw out the trash and thanks to all you people that think it ' s wonderful to include a swear word or two in your signature files that ' s really nice i have to read the whole article and then toss it out because of the . sig do n ' t get me wrong i know all the words you do and i ' ve even made up some of my own or i would n ' t be able to edit them out but this just does n ' t seem to be the place a public forum to spew foul language sorry thanks to all you people that keep in mind there might be some decent young people interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup they enjoy your articles .

discussion deleted my hockey education what the f are you talking about i ' m not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement i hate the habs you sound like a qqq old this statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey do n ' t give me this crap about cogent arguments i ' ve yet to read something of yours that is cogent you consistently argue with qqq emotion qqq huge sweeping statements frankly you have a very unconvincing style i ' m not defending bob gainey frankly i do n ' t care for him all that much but your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresome it has no basis in anything how many calders did he win i think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory what about the conn smythe was that a fluke yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar i know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down hey cowboy you ' re the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieux you figure it out how many individual awards between them eight i do n ' t remember once again please feel free to refresh my memory and try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education oh my god did i say that roger what ' s your point fuhr is a goaltender goaltender ' s do n ' t plug in his prime he was one of the best sanderson was a scrapper if you stick him on you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era oh roger you shouldn ' t really i do n ' t deserve this you are far too accomodating already you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous statement that ' s why if you want to debate gainey go ahead but why bring up everybody else how does it support your argument do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us great i could n ' t agree more the flyers won two cups for the same reasons deservedly so so what i do n ' t get it are you angry that the leafs did n ' t get more recognition you seem to think these pluggers are hyped i do n ' t agree plain and simple if you ' re last statement is some sort of compromise fair enough not a pleasant bone in your body eh rog why are you so unhappy not getting invited to enough parties what roger why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour you really should stop it sounds a little bit pathetic frankly it ' s about as honourable as a good fart congenially as always jd james david qqq
but it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely useless for first basemen from the raw stats there is no way to tell which of a first baseman ' s putouts were made on throws from other fielders and which were made on his own plays likewise you ca n ' t tell whether a double play was qqq qqq qqq or qqq qqq qqq fielding runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and errors it thus favors first basemen who play deep reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently it also hurts first baseman who play behind left handed pitching staffs and thus face few left handed batters this is better of course it still is n ' t all of a first baseman ' s defense defensive average which uses larger and probably better zones has mattingly tied for second in the league while qqq batting runs is good it is mostly in the past the runs he produced in qqq do n ' t say much about his value in qqq .

dale hunter ties the game scoring his third goal of the game with qqq seconds remaining in regulation you could feel it coming on due to contractual agreements espn will be unable to carry the rest of this game live so that we may show you a worthless early season battle between those two pennant contenders the cleveland indians and the california angels when the winning goal is scored we will do the grave injustice of breaking into the baseball game something reserved only for the deaths of presidents or the trading of joe montana to the chiefs to show you the goal on instant replay are n ' t you so lucky to have national coverage of hockey it ' s heidi all over again dammit !
why do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until he reaches his seventy third birthday or something why is it such a strange concept that a forty one year old ozzie smith might be a defensive liability in qqq ?
the subject line says it all is it terribly difficult to get tickets to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs would it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets ?
really what makes you think the islanders have a better shot they could n ' t even beat the whalers in two games well since you ' re a pens fans the whole question is moot i think the teams most likely to beat the pens are the bruins nordiques and blackhawks but i do n ' t think they can really do it )
charles hubbert writes chevy has let in qqq or qqq soft goals so far but they all did n ' t matter however his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts the score was qqq qqq i think when the goal you mentioned was scored in the third period when it looked like toronto was coming back chevy was exceptional i can see him as a barraso style playoff goalie inconsistant when there ' s nothing on the line but comes up big when really needed i guess we ' ll both find out ron
am i supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down just wondering i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet especially for those in the east coast who ca n ' t get final scores for west coast games in their newspapers or late tv newscasts this is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week also many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through bbs ' s or some pay news services by the way mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec . sport . baseball newsgroup other than that everything is done through private e mail currently there are qqq people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others and the list grows by an average of qqq people a day if people on usenet really do n ' t want to see the postings i do to rec . sport . baseball on a daily basis please just let me know if the response is overwhelming against the posts i wo n ' t do it anymore thanks for your time joseph hernandez joseph hernandez rams _ | _ _ lakers jtchern @ ocf berkeley edu kings _ _ dodgers _ | _ _ raiders jtcent @ soda berkeley edu angels | ____ | _ | _ | ___ clippers

it ' s called contractual obligations with major league baseball i would ' ve liked to see the ot of the isles caps game but i understand where espn is coming from espn is committed to a single telecast a night and everything after that is a bonus .
there was apparently a qqq minute special here on the penguins season on abc wtae channel qqq immediately preceding the opening game against the devils on sunday i only turned it on in time to watch the credits if anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow it to dub it i would appreciate it i would be willing to come pick it up and i ' ll return it the next day and buy you a beer please respond via e mail thanks a lot oh yeah was it any good - billy
i do nt know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums the batter faces northeast and so when a pitcher is on the mound his left arm is to the south hence the term .

kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielson roger needs players who ca n ' t think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the ice dudley and nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and not know how to turn them into bure and selanne get muckler as coach and kovalev will look like mogilny the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got players like messier kovalev and graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches who are interested in rope a dope strategies if you want the roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you do n ' t go out and get a mark messier who is an old dog who ca n ' t learn new tricks from a known loser and you do n ' t waste your draft picks on players like kovalev gerald
it is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus have simply been too damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained you can be sure however that i will somehow manage to find time to woof if the leafs give just cause and let ' s all try to keep people ' s names especially mine out of the subject headers i for one neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form of notoriety one thing you can be assured of however is this the leafs are the best of all the teams in the league that have allowed qqq goals in qqq games -
here we go again is this the same idiot who posted the gretzky trade to toronto sheeeesh you should have waited until we got over that one before this garbage maybe we would have believed it for half a second not by the way i just heard from mother goose that mario lemieux was traded to winnpeg for tie domi !
ooops that should read selke forgive me for my insolence congenially as always jd james david qqq

it was my impression watching the mets rockies that umpires were calling strikes above the belt too but not as far up as the letters it would be nice if this were the case .
it is meaningless to compare one player ' s plus minus statistic with another players out of the context of the role and the playing time of the players involved to compare jagr ' s and francis ' s plus minus is ridiculous and absurd .
not clear to me at all i ' d certainly rather have a team who was winning qqq qqq games than qqq qqq games in the qqq qqq game luck is going to play a much bigger role than in the qqq qqq game .
the tribe will be in town from april qqq to the qqq there are always tickets available though they are playing toronto and many toronto fans make the trip to cleveland as it is easier to get tickets in cleveland than in toronto either way i seriously doubt they will sell out until the end of the season )
i ' d have to say the most impressive hrs i ' ve ever see came from dave kingman and his infamous moon raker drives i remember one he hit circa qqq at wrigley field that went across the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof he whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not roger clemens sorry val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to incaviglia which was literally at inky ' s neck and he absolutely hammered the crap out of it after the swing clemens nonchalantly motioned for a new ball he did n ' t even turn around to look or even get upset the ball hit the lights in the left field standard some qqq or so feet about the green monster over qqq feet above the ground total truly an amazing shot .
i do n ' t know if anyone has posted a message like this yet but i ' m getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey game in which the score was just tied and then cutting out and saying sorry we ca n ' t show you this we have to show baseball tonight not even a game a friggin highlight show gee sure would have been nice to see the isles caps in overtime i live in pittsburgh yes i ' m a pens fan where hockey gets a lot of coverage i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in texas must feel .
sorry to disappoint you but the red wings earned the victory easily i watched most of the game on espn as soon as i realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second the maple leafs were flat very flat meanwhile the red wings were skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game i did n ' t detect any bad penalty calls van hellemond did his usual good job toronto looked like how i expected them to for their first playoff game in a few years nervous for the leafs sake i hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies for game qqq if game qqq is indicative of the series it ' s gon na go quick .

not particularly in the world series during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him umm roger return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used of ws rings as a measure of better the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday unless this transaltes to clemens has n ' t gone into lou gorman ' s office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he ' d been traded to the jays i ' m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it what on earth does this mean over their careers clemens has won qqq of the games he ' s started morris qqq per year clemens has averaged nearly qqq wins morris just under qqq would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game if so then consider that clemens allows qqq qqq innings pitched morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in qqq had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right speaking of stupid it has been patiently and not so patiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs out just like it did in qqq when he pitched qqq more innings than qqq gave up exactly one earned run more than in qqq and went qqq qqq seriously roger i ' d really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the qqq morris and the qqq morris which one was a better pitcher and why did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years if so then why did he go qqq qqq in qqq with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than qqq mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com
and not the only quality mariner pitcher i logged on expecting to see at least one congratulatory note for chris bosio ' s no hitter but nary a peep so i ' ll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now qqq qqq and slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games or even a hit in last night ' s gem not that we m ' s fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers of new england ' s long running tragedy but only one winning season in history is something of a burden to bear so we ' ll take our joys when we can get ' em the mariners now have two no hit pitchers on the staff and not coincidentally those pitchers beat the red sox in back to back games jsh

well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs would griffin then be better than larkin no i am not trying to define the quality of an individual at least not for the purpose of ranking them toronto won with olerud they might have won with fielder they might not have won with thomas detroit might have won with thomas chicago might have won with fielder you ca n ' t rank these individuals you can only look at who might contribute more to the team effort which is winning the ws thomas could not have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i can not say that olerud is less of a player -

yes he does but the goalie sure as hell does n ' t want him there when i played roller hockey boy do i miss those days as a goalie i would scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot i do n ' t care if he ' s in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball yes roller hockey remember and if there was nobody around to clear the slot then i ' d do it myself by pushing the offending player * hard i hate people in my way when i ' m the goalie and i am sure felix does too i should say that i did n ' t see the incident so if potvin really swung the stick big time then that ' s not right but he can move people out of the way he ' s a player on the ice too you know )
like many others i too was watching the caps isles game when the went to the baseball game i too was pissed how could they interupt such an important game i understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games anyway us blues and hawks fans got shafted worse while everyone in the u . s and watched the game on abc however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus telethon the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision this game had it been televised would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since qqq this television bull has got to stop we are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv peace hammer

sigh here we go again must i if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if i can define the skill in hitting a baseball that ' s all i ' ve said except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations i did not say i could predict the future i ' ve suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless here ' s the data for this situation non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq samuel qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i ' m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just would n ' t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct one more time i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo and i am not dismissing your work i ' m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work i did not say that clutch hitting is well defined i said that the data is significant to me i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever called you or anyone else on r . s . b stupid it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases ah i knew we could get to the name calling and there ' s that word you like so much wait a minute i thought i first had to define clutch hitting do i or do n ' t i i made two statements in my post qqq i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting qqq i would have hit for sabo as for qqq many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball i ' m not shy about it i ' ll make the statement again i believe that by season ' s end that chris sabo ' s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i ca n ' t prove that it will happen so i guess we ' ll just have to wait and see here ' s another one for you in qqq qqq joe carter ' s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random non clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq so what could we expect in qqq from mr carter well his composite ba through qqq was qqq through qqq was qqq through qqq was qqq so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce in qqq he hit qqq not surprising huh also in qqq non clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq no this does n ' t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in qqq joe carter ' s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations as for qqq above i have plenty of company john dewan of stats inc is the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text bill james makes numerous references to a player ' s ability to hit well in the clutch i am not saying that i can predict the future any more than they are you and others are saying that your work renders their statements and mine meaningless i do n ' t accept that which in your words proves that i am a total idiot stupid total idiot my my such hostility the beastmaster
actually this stuff from mogilny does n ' t surprise me all that much about qqq or qqq weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex it went something like sarcastically yep patty ' s the man he ' s responsible for the team ' s success i ' m a nobody around here i was going to post it at the time i must have forgot since nobody else was talking about him being a problem yep i ' d beat the shit out of him too lafontaine really must be a team player makes you wonder what the islander management was thinking my question is what the hell is muckler doing whether he wishes to admit it or not the team is his to coach and if he ca n ' t do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can gee kinda like alex ' s spot on the team is n ' t it ?
i need the box score from the april qqq game i believe the score was qqq to qqq if anyone can provide it for me i would appreciate it .
do you have a basis for this claim try these stats taken from playboy magazine june qqq percentage of pro football fans who have attended college qqq percentage of pro baseball fans who have attended college qqq percentage of pro basketball fans who have attended college qqq percentage of pro hockey fans who have attended college qqq percentage of pro football fans who earn more than qqq k qqq percentage of pro baseball fans who make more than qqq k qqq percentage of pro basketball fans who make more than qqq k qqq percentage of pro hackey fans who make more than qqq k qqq the biggest advantage that kids from boondock or weedville have is the availability of ice in the san jose area we have a population of qqq and that population is served by qqq ice arenas in contrast kamloops british columbia has a population of about qqq and has qqq rinks there are also myriad ponds pools etc that freeze in the winter down here it ' s hard to find a kid without a bicycle up there it ' s hard to find a kid without a pair of skates and before you say what does he know he ' s from california let me say that i was born and raised in trail british columbia a town of about qqq with lots of ice in the winter my father did radio play by play for the local team the trail smokeaters who by the way were the last canadian team to win the world championship back in qqq i was on skates almost as soon as i could walk and have been playing recreational hockey for about qqq years lack of ice is a big factor but costs is a bigger factor both my kids play for the santa clara valley hockey association and this season which just ended cost me qqq per kid for membership in hockey usa plus qqq per kid for club dues the hockey usa fees cover excess medical insurance and the club dues cover ice time officials trophies etc other areas have similar fees unless the city government subsidises some of the costs as stockton does by the way most ice arenas are located in what could be called the inner city areas eastridge and vallco are exceptions redwood city ' s rink is in an industrial area on bay rd near qqq berkeley ' s is near ashby and martin luther king stockton ' s is in oak park sacramento ' s is in an older section of downtown i forget the name of the street fresno ' s is out on the edge of town just west of qqq santa rosa ' s is a nice rink but it ' s in an older section of town dublin ' s is outside of town off qqq most of the rinks are old and expensive to run with huge electric bills and insurance premiums if you want to buy ice time expect to pay around qqq per hour at any of these rinks some of them give you a qqq minute hour for your money others give you a qqq minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee .
after the marvelous time out call by chris webber which resulted in a technical foul since his team had no time outs left perhaps webber will take the place of bill buckner as the master of choke at least this red sox fan hopes so ted
i ca n ' t believe sh * t like this gets any attention in this group during the playoffs ali you ' re a blabbering moron at least you could ' ve waited till the end of the playoffs to start your dumb letter campaign .
a lot of teams carry qqq catchers on their qqq man roster but the qqq catcher is seldom ever used he is only insurance in case of extra innings or the qqq catcher is injured during a game so to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not invoke a catcher re substitution rule if the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game given this rule a team would n ' t need qqq roster catchers the qqq catcher could be playing in aaa or be a non roster bullpen catcher .
i ' d like to add that i think canadian hockey fans like don because his kind of hockey the hockey he promotes in his tv appearances is the kind that they think used to get played in the old qqq team nhl so there ' s a kind of nostagia for the old days before expansion the soviet series gretzky and even bobby orr when guys were n ' t afraid to take a hit nobody floated and defensemen played defence who cares that that probably never really existed the myth is still around in canada and all the european in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people ' s eyes personally i ' d like to add before i get flamed i love the fast paced european game and think don cherry is a bit of an idiot i have to say that i missed him when i was living in the states though he is entertaining even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he ' s on i stand by all the misstatements that i ' ve made vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson qqq
regardless they ' d have to sparkle from the pressbox errey ' s been out a couple games with a hip injury .

indeed if the color teal on a team ' s uniforms is any indication of the future the marlins are in dire trouble refer to the san jose sharks for proof but i have hope for the marlins i was a sometime member of the rene lachemann fan club at the oakland coliseum and have a deep respect for the guy he ' s a gem and of course walt weiss gives that franchise class but yeah whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination ugghhh !
i really think that this is the key point when i saw the incident on baseball tonight sunday i could n ' t believe how far away from the plate gant went then he casually leaned against his bat i do n ' t blame the umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch the worst part of the whole incident was the braves coming out onto the field what were they going to do attack the umpire the only people who should ' ve been out there were cox and maybe the coaches but no players i agree with the person who posted before that cox should be suspended for having no control over his team .
the o ' s just lost to the rangers a few minutes ago i was not too happy about the pitching of rick sutcliffe qqq runs in qqq innings qqq in the qqq this puts me in remembering the qqq o ' s season after qqq we did n ' t do much over winter and we wound up in qqq now i know that mussina mcdonald and rhodes are better pitching prospects than ballard and milacki but are any other oriole fans scared out there admiral steve c liu
this is not a trend the caps were done goneso in five games and it saves us caps fans a lot of pain i mean it would be more painful if the caps were up qqq qqq watching them tumbled when they need one more win to clinch the series how many times have they done that in their history qqq up qqq qqq in a five game series against the isles lost qqq straight qqq up qqq qqq against the isles lost qqq straight qqq up qqq qqq against the pens lost qqq straight in other words when they were about to clinch with qqq games to go they were a pitiful qqq qqq the lone wins being qqq a sweep of philly in qqq qqq the qqq win against the rangers in the patrick finals the only time they managed to get out of the division actually saturday ' s blown lead was n ' t anything new we all know the caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games examples qqq game qqq against the isles qqq led qqq qqq after two lead series qqq qqq gave up qqq goals in the qqq period including the game winning goal in the last minute after that goal bobby carpenter botched a penalty shot series tied qqq qqq lost game qqq a few days later qqq game qqq against the rangers qqq led series qqq qqq led by qqq in the qqq period blew it lost game in ot and three consecutive games qqq game qqq against pittsurgh qqq led series qqq qqq led by qqq in qqq period blew it and the series qqq game qqq against isles qqq series tied qqq qqq led by qqq after qqq blew it qqq game qqq against isles qqq trailed series qqq qqq led by qqq in qqq period blew it again when they were leading by qqq in game qqq i said to myself if they blew this lead the series is over they have lost all the momemtum the islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is i am still waiting for a cap goalie who can carry the team who can completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear lives in a crucial game well some teams such have it and some teams just do n ' t when the caps were frustrated year in year out by the islanders i was thinking wait until potvin bossy trottier smith retire well they retired even though trottier was still able to haunt the caps on a pens uniform yet another generation of islanders were still doing the same thing well i guess it has nothing to do with the players .
let ' s look at the effects of inflation on qqq ' s superstars salaries i read once that the babe made qqq one year and that was about as good as it got for him let ' s assume he made that in qqq i ' m not sure of the figures but i know i ' m in the ballpark pun intended today assuming a qqq yearly inflation rate which is an understatement if not accurate his measly qqq salary would be worth fv qqq x qqq qqq qqq qqq x qqq just over qqq assuming inflation is average of around qqq fv qqq x qqq qqq almost qqq i did n ' t crunch these numbers beforehand these numbers might lead one to believe that today ' s players are slightly overpaid the babe appears to have made then what today ' s average to above average players make now perfectly accurate salary year of salary and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate but i don ` t think i ' m off by much chop chop michael mule '

like clinton and reno i accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster my wife and i picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre season projected sox offense like all no no ' s bosio was good lucky hard grounder by vaughn off t martinez glove but straight to boone who threw to bosio at first qqq qqq qqq and backed by good defense many non trivial groundouts the game was amazingly fast as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also working fast the sox relief pitching was ok the runs off quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch greenwell ' s mental stability is a serious concern i guess it has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was an mvp candidate wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently johnson made an ok i ' ve got to stay focused gesture which iron mike interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the next two times as valentine noted last night he came up in the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game can you say take the first pitch not mike who dribbled it into a qqq qqq qqq the pi quoted bosio that this was a batting practice fastball next time up he also hit the first pitch a hard liner straight to kgjr in center he also made the pathetic error and failed to catch boone ' s hr which looked comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight reel that night is riles suppsoed to be good defensively i could n ' t tell from the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a dp that cost a run or two why was he leadoff i hope fletcher gets well soon also on lineups pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond me it seemed to work as he was qqq qqq with a hr and some good defense a wag behind us said he sure do n ' t want to go back to calgary there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they ' ll likely lead off the second as boone did well now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in langston a reminder that contest entries are open through next wednesday i expect a surge of pessimism by the way ties will be broken by earliest entry one entry per person or pseudonym please and easy on the pseudonyms .
as she said the letter is addressed to bettman the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here that ' s an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to bettman unfortunately the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent as for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on r . s . h who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point and just for my own curiosity i thought i ' d look up the official definition of large in the dictionary it reads large qqq having more than usual power capacity or scope qqq exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them qqq people may be up there thereby validating definition qqq i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope why would he be impressed with this unless it were large i am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak i personally do n ' t know whether or not i agree with the letter i have very mixed emotions about it i like the names as they are and do n ' t think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change .
it was not krupp ' s skate krupp was defending against steve tuttle of the blues they both sort of tripped and fell toward malarchuk and tuttle ' s skate came perilously close to cutting but actually just missed the jugular malarchuk immediately fell to the ice hands at his neck blood on the ice he ' d been suffering from it for over a decade he just was n ' t diagnosed for it until he did n ' t sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep unfortunately he ' d just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier it ' s amazing he lasted as long as he did ocd sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination or fail to accept that something they ' ve checked is ok now for example an ocd sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they ' re dirty he might check the oven ten times to be sure it ' s turned off he might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes but still needs it he went off it this past winter and had a bad ocd episode and i think was in the hospital for a couple days he felt it slowed his reflexes so he tried to go without in any event he is alive and well and living in san diego while playing with the gulls ihl and tuttle is no longer with the blues but i do n ' t know where he is possibly in the ihl but you ' d best ask a blues fan .
tes did anyone think that texas would have the top two home run leaders at a given point in the season and neither one would be jose canseco steve ]
it ' s just as meaningless to compare goals assists pim and any other stat i can think of each player is asked to take a unique role for his team the contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams and yet awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats the operative words are in part stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one has about the player and comparing jagr ' s and francis ' s points is just as ridiculous and absurd but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points for selanne lindros juneau potvin and the other rookies in the league and yet how about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game .
in any case i think viola would have made a better signing why viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does toronto have well i agree that viola is a better signing however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters i just do n ' t understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect e . g yankee stadium most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhp ' s than rhp ' s however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties lefthanded starters tend to have higher era ' s than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage am i missing something here ?

also alomar got a far greater boost from his home park than baerga did from his and six or seven home runs hmm so if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in toronto you ' d take alomar anywhere else and you ' d probably take baerga mike

qqq qqq organization eskimo north qqq qqq qqq eskimo . com yeah morris just knows how to win that ' s why he lost qqq for detroit in qqq funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones and if rings was the only criteria for success then teams would always tend to repeat and eventually you ' d have the same team win the ws every bleepin year sort of like the yanks in the qqq morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good not great career toronto will finish qqq or qqq this year with morris and all those rings because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off season .
you know after i finished laughing i thought this would be a great final two canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that don cherry nonsense behind them and a nail biter finish of course i would prefer a vancouver montreal final with vancouver scoring the final goal pity neither will happen .

o . k it would be a shame for cards fans on the net to go through the qqq championship season without a mailing list to talk on so i would be willing to look at starting one except there ' s one little problem i do n ' t know the first thing about how to do it or what it requires in terms of resources or time so if some kind soul could e mail me the particulars of getting starting and managing a mail list i ' d see if it would be feasible for me to start a cards mailing list thanks in advance dick detweiler
wait a minute if i read the rules right a stike is any portion of the ball over any portion of the plate given that the ball is qqq in diameter this sez that the zone width is qqq qqq qqq or qqq while this is still less than the qqq number given i can forgive any ump for misjudging qqq on an object moving at qqq to qqq miles per hour many times not in a straight line i think the umpires union has a great grasp of the rules !
okay i ' m curious why are you expectin the commissioner to fly in and stand on the pitchers mound to yell at the fans to sit down or what ?

but good ones can collapse somewhat then come back the next year burleigh grimes went from qqq wins and an era of qqq or so in qqq to qqq qqq and an era around qqq in qqq he pitched well for several more years carlton won qqq and lost qqq the year after his qqq qqq record source bill james historical baseball abstract and let ' s not forget john tudor who started qqq qqq and finished qqq qqq in qqq he had a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at the start of the season if i recall he had a qqq era in the qqq half and a qqq era in the qqq half of last year hmmm qqq runs in qqq innings suppose he starts qqq more games and winds up qqq innings pitched if he allows qqq runs a game in the next qqq innings he ' ll have a qqq era or so at the end of the year i think i have his totals right this is going to be hard to come back from my qqq hunch is that morris is very gutsy and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone my qqq guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts perhaps when stewart comes off the dl or will danny cox who went qqq or qqq scoreless innings against the tribe today start for morris he looks like a really good one gaston is scrambling to find starters i ' d imagine luckily the jays have a very good offense i do n ' t think they would dare release him before the end of the year he ' ll just be replaced by stewart or cox .
as far as i know a save opportunity is when it is qqq inning or beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game for example if it is the bottom of the qqq inning and clemens is pithching the red sox are leading qqq qqq and clemens has just givin up a hit so there is a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer if jeff russel came in the red sox reliever and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score he would get the save and clemens would get the win that s how i beleive it works .
the r . s . h faq sheet never fails to crash my newsreader the only way i can avoid crashing and restarting the machine is to look at the headers and avoid reading the faq does anyone else have problems reading the faq ?
the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population and have suggested various remedies such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that smoke ' embake ' emdominatebysheerintimidation is an accurate description of what is essentially a laid back game forget those lame ideas here is my new and exciting two point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses point one sex point two violence let ' s face it sex and violence are the only things that sell in america here ' s how we can implement them in the game sex cheerleaders cheerleaders and more cheerleaders dancing on top of the dugouts bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch running up and down the stands the south bend white sox actually do this violence baseball players are such utter wuss boys the pitcher beans the batter and both benches empty in what is called a bench clearing brawl everybody just stands there and looks at each other stand stand stand look look look ho hum then the bullpens come running in when they reach the fight they just stand there too anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined further the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield football sex violence basketball sex violence hockey violence baseball da pastime of da nayshun yawn .
not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their teams in the regular season just too much intensity during the regular season i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read this item gee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the playoffs kind of makes you wonder bottom line man it is great to be smoking the warthawks agreed jim this has been damn sweet so far about the only thing that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fans detroit has completely kicked their asses so far but i will stick with the blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far .

could some kind soul out there e mail me the qqq on where i can find the mlb . c program i ' m interested in some road trips this year .
did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night he addressed this exact issue and dismissed it rather quickly according to gammons advanced scouts are reporting that morris fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release guzman and stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach gammons looks to see morris back in top form within the month i on the other hand still have my doubts morris era last year was rather high for a pitcher who won qqq games his showing in the series was not surprising although i ' m not convinced that he ' s washed up i have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the twins in qqq .
why are the red sox in first place eight games into the season they already have two wins each from clemens and viola clemens starts again tonight on three days rest what ' s up are the sox going with a four man rotation is this why hesketh was used in relief last night hm .
agreed here i ' ll never forget dan kelly calling the play by play in the qqq canada cup he was masterful and danny gallivan will _ never _ be replaced even now when i watch hnic i remember his voice when i see an al macinnis or al iafrate hey what ' s with these guys named al who can shoot shot from the point i still think blistering blast thn had a tribute to gallivan in the issue following his death in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did it went it appears risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check he said and will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition classic vintage gallivan he ' s sorely missed so here ' s to two of the best there was and best that ever will be .
actually i was hoping for barry bonds oh well first off jeff has had like qqq hits in the last two games and walked yet again sorry ken but jeff king does have some power which means his slg wo n ' t be below qqq and his walks are way up if that increase is real jeff king will be an above average nl third baseman in qqq jose lind on the other hand still does n ' t walk and clearly is n ' t a qqq hitter my bet is that he wo n ' t be getting any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the lind shift we were seeing in the nl no although since the lavalliere weirdness nothing would really surprise me jeff king is currently in the top qqq in the league in walks something is up .
i ' m telling you sam three l ' s call up mom and ask .
qqq management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing i meant argument instead of agreement also i think i should add a coouple of ted ' s positive achievements smiley trade was good for the pirates but i think ted could have gotten someone better than neagle cummings seems to be pretty good the cole trade was excellent but simmons has botched it up now - this year ' s draft seems to have gone well for the pirates but then they lost qqq high picks in the bonds fiasco .
stuff deleted the last year before bryan murray took over the wings did not make the playoffs while they had been considered a possible contender when jacques demers first arrived in his last two years they were respectively embarrassed in the first round by chicago and then failed to make the playoffs at a time a might add when there were only five teams in the norris it ' s true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before quinn came but in those years the smythe division was a lot i mean a lot tougher division than the norris also known as the snorris division vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contenders eight times a year while detroit got to play such powerhouses as toronto and minnesota now edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks while over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving so was everybody in the norris except st louis detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent for really good players they had yzerman burr and probert and that was about it and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team then even his coaching began to degrade there are a number of reasons why detroit was n ' t in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc was when quinn took over some of which i outlined above but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn with the exception of yzerman and one player can not alone make a team into a stanley cup contender as i ' m sure everyone reading this will agree we ' ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final assuming they do n ' t get knocked out like last year .
dear anybody i am in rochester ny where people can look at a rangers penguins playoff game and say no joke i heard it hey what s this oh its not even the ahl its just the nhl i think because of this e get red wings orioles aaa stats and updates but no al or nl stats specifically i m looking for red sox stats so far i d like all of them but could handle just greenwell and vaughn can anybody please help me !
the problem is that by no fault of espn ongoing games are not covered til the final horn sounds with two channels scny and sca late finishing games up to pacific time and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage if scny is blocked by the mets there is still some hockey on sca scny plus with an espn qqq the current situation would be alleviated gld
they ' re real and they ' re spectacular the blues shutout the blackhawks in consecutive playoff games if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday i will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game not that there ' s anything wrong with that curtis joseph has been the master of his own domain and the hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers not even superman could play any better in goal joseph must have been eating his cereal it ' s like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the arena it was very refreshing to see the blues double dip the hawks the hawks goons tried to pick on hull janney and joseph but the blues checking line nipped those hawks real well the fat yoyoma will sing on sunday and the hawks will head to the beach the hawks trip back to chicago will feel like a long journey from milan to minsk enjoy sunday ' s game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple just a little fun .
if anybody is having problems following the thread be sure to ask the origonal poster to rectify your misunderstanding .
ok ok ok first my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request but here goes anyhow i ' m very interested in finding out how i might be able to get two tickets for the all star game in baltimore this year my very aged folks live about qqq miles away and i know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game i went with them and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child to the all star game in dc many years ago although i ' m now in the sf bay area i ' d love to be able to treat my folks to this game it ' s absolutely the last chance they ' d ever have to attend this g ame locally any info would be greatly appreciated !
does n ' t it also have the statue of liberty on it or is that richter ' s mask the back actually has a bee followed by a z to represent the beezer it also has something that looks like the three interconnecting circles from the led zepplin qqq album cover is that what it is supposed to be and if it is does anybody know why he would put it there ali john the official language of golf is profanity "
i ' ll have to disagree with you on this one i think vancouver will go as bure goes and if he continues on his goal scoring slump then they wo n ' t even make it out of the first round i think the kings will make it out of the first round regardless of who they play they seem to be doing pretty well even with that bad game against minnesota on saturday i think it ' ll be either calgary or los angeles to win the smythe i . e go on to the conference finals .
i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series and in fact all year have been pretty much consistently correct remember the rule says it ' s a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone i would certainly agree that high strikes are not called who could argue this point but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well .
let ' s see april qqq less than qqq at bats and you claim that he has n ' t done too much so far cut this guy some slack danny will produce this year it ' s scary to think just how much he ' ll produce if he were to stay healthy all year the yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation good bullpen good defense and a good lineup also i like buck showalter frank howard on qqq is also a good move everything sounds good so far if the yanks stay healthy they have a good chance at winning the pennant this is the most fun i ' ve had watching the yanks since qqq !
minor point shea stadium was designed as a multi purpose stadium but not with the jets in mind as the tennant the new york football giants had moved to yankee stadium from the polo grounds in qqq and was having problem with stadium management the city did not own yankee stadium until qqq the idea was to get the giants to move into shea when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the new afl franchise the new york titans approached the city about using the new stadium the titans were playing in downing stadium where the cosmos played soccer in the qqq because shea stadium was tied into the world ' s fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the world ' s fair like they were doing with the mets so the deal was worked out i ' m under the impression that when murph says it he means it as a regular goer to shea it is not a bad place since they ' ve cleaned and renovated the place remember this is its qqq year !
and boris majorov has made a qqq qqq year deal with tappara .
ted frank ' s list of underpaid players was this what do all of these players have in common they do not qualify for arbitration they were never free agents it ' s called the reserve clause look it up and a year from now we will whine about how several of these guys are way overpaid and getting outrageous raises in arb humbug .
off and on over the last several months threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player ' s rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position risp that he bats with in the qqq model bill james calculated predicted rbis as qqq bases home runs this completely ignores the context which was all that qqq could do since context was unknown to it so i thought i ' d take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing rbi home runs to slg * risp i ' ve started with team data using data from the elias ' s that i ' ve picked up over the years when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increasing elias ' s profits that gave me the years qqq qqq qqq and qqq i do n ' t have team rbis for qqq or i could add that year if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get rbi home runs qqq the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is qqq which is significant at a ridiculously high level so i feel like the fit is good at the team level i ' ve no started to move on to the player level and have looked at qqq players will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly i hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year it does n ' t do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie the results rbi hr years actual predicted carter qqq qqq qqq qqq clark qqq qqq qqq matt ' ly qqq qqq qqq qqq smith qqq qqq qqq qqq i think we can make a case and i hope to make it stronger that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up more later harold
from matthew rush it ' s pretty obvious that holik ' s hitting barrasso was an accident he was even apologizing for it immediately before the penguins all jumped on him .
about qqq is correct for numminen and lumme no kurri ' s points are too low qqq for kurri and qqq for sel { nne that ' s true game is so different here in europe compared to nhl north ame ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks an average european player from sweden finland russian or tsech slovakia is a better skater and puckhandler than his nhl colleague especially defenders in nhl are mainly slow and clumsy sel { nne has also said that in the finnish sm league game is more based on skill than in nhl in finland he could n ' t get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in nhl also alpo suhonen said that in nhl sel { nne ' s speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen i have to admit that the best players come from canada but those regulars are n ' t as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues also top europeans are in the same level as the best north americans ( except lemieux is in the class of his own .
that his positive clint malarchuk what has happened to him since assigned to san diego gulls at the being of the season i believe what it was uwe krupp and a blues player though uwe ' s skate i beleive cut clint he has since be traded to the isles in the lafontaine deal has this ever this is the only time i know of .
let ' s start over i ' m not arguing about who is the better goaltender i ' d take soderstrom right now what i am saying is that roussel can be a qqq netminder the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar and with that i just do n ' t see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season you say soderstrom played against better competition that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose but i ' m not just judging roussel on that game alone i ' ve seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey it ' s just my opinion but i think he ' s got what it takes of course i thought that about mark laforest too but i never did about wendell young so i ' m batting qqq in judging hershey talent since the hextall era as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou had his leg in position to make the save if he did n ' t it would n ' t have mattered if the rangers player did n ' t get the puck up or not it would have been a goal on a breakaway that ' s what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending champs and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs but you ca n ' t tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game or there ' d never be shutouts anyway i ' m happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and i ' m not going to argue about it anymore besides with the current qqq winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i do n ' t want to piss you off to the point that you do n ' t sell me any tickets next season .
why did i get sucked into this assuming you ' re serious i guess you ' d be surprised to hear that us guys do n ' t think so i would guess that a tiny fraction of qqq of the folks reading your post agree with it i kind of doubt that even you agree with it i ' m not going to go through your points one at a time because after all not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball i ' m only replying to this because you brought up pam postema the aaa umpire who sued is suing baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she was n ' t promoted to the majors i ' ve never seen her ump a game i have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire but i have seen her on talk shows and her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most it seems to me that she is missing the point and if that ' s how she sees the role of umpires in the game well i would n ' t promote her either the umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out hell joe lundy could do that their primary function is to maintain order in the game keep the game moving and keep the players from trying to kill each other umpires have to be extremely tough people that disqualifies most of us both men and women and if ms postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook then i think that disqualifies her as well umpires need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary .
for the second straight game california scored a ton of late runs to crush the brewhas it was six runs in the qqq for a qqq qqq win monday and five in the qqq and six in the qqq for a qqq qqq win yesterday jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings but orosco austin manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday how ' s this for numbers maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarro ' s era is qqq the next lowest on the staff is wegman at qqq ouch it does n ' t look much better for the hitters hamilton is batting qqq while thon is hitting qqq and has seven rbi the next highest is three the next best hitter is jaha at qqq and then vaughn who has the team ' s only hr at qqq another ouch looking at the stats it ' s not hard to see why the team is qqq qqq in fact qqq qqq does n ' t sound bad when you ' re averaging three runs game and giving up qqq still it ' s early and things will undoubtedly get better the offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry fetters plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year lloyd maldanado manzanillo fetters austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place the starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark in other news nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday while william suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal today ' s game with california was cancelled .

to encourage the great tradition of red sox negativism i am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the sox fall from their current heights you must decide first whether the sox will be at qqq again at any time during this year then you must predict either qqq their record the first time they ' re at qqq if they are or qqq their final record if they stay above qqq the rest of the year so valentine ' s earlier prediction would go as qqq qqq resend it if you were serious val espn pointed out last night that the last sox start better than this was in qqq when they finished qqq qqq in sixth place so email me your guess either at barring @ cs . washington . edu or directly replying to this post entries close qqq pm pdt on we d qqq apr qqq .
the only way to change espn ' s thinking if it is even possible is to complain to them directly anyone know there telephone in bristol ct i do find it hard to believe that espn does n ' t think viewers will simply change the channel from a boring game i know i did and then when they did n ' t show the nyi wash overtime ( s i was livid if i wanted to watch baseball i could have turned on the phillies padres extra inning game instead i went to bed angry i boycotted espn ' s morning sportscenter today i was still so incensed my wife says i should n ' t go to bed angry but last nite grrrrrrr !

there ' s a blurb in the stats scoreboard about this and though i do n ' t have the book with me here my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were far below this qqq number .
tonight will see the toronto maple leafs as some have guessed come out hitting the buds will grind detroit into the ground and walk away with home ice advantage for the remainder of the series which given a shift to toronto will not last long keep in mind this is only a predicition wendall will have to get into the game however otherwise probert will dominate on the physical front .
could be there is a jayson stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate and also for baseball america stark has done this sort of thing but he has never been serious about it he usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of such columns i think he did it one season and some manager was projected to be thrown out of qqq games and some hitter could expect to be plunked qqq times stark does some really funny stuff his weekly baseball reviews are good collections of strange things that happened during the previous week he also regularly prints kinerisms .
er yes if manny lee was on your team last year your team would have been the toronto blue jays again if manny lee was on your team last year your team would not have been the albuquerque leftturns it would have been the toronto blue jays that ' s the whole point is n ' t it clemens did n ' t get a ring but morris did exactly and morris was part of the team would the jays have won with clemens we will never know but we do know that the jays won with morris so how could you possibly say that clemens had a better year no pitcher in baseball could have had a better year than morris had last year -
me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it qqq

i know it ' s very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but let ' s give credit where credit is due it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris last year when the team went qqq qqq for the month of august and all the other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went qqq qqq with a pretty good era i ca n ' t remember exactly also let ' s not underestimate the importance his qqq innings to save the bullpen every fifth day if he did n ' t help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series his run support was high qqq runs but so was stottlemyer ' s qqq runs and he won only qqq games i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of qqq qqq and qqq qqq ballgames but this is to his credit he pitched only as good as he needed to be when he was up qqq qqq in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down but morris being a veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line yes morris is crapping out big time this year but let ' s not change history to suit the present btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is qqq how much more can he be embarrassed ditto !
to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career the answer is johnny mize in his career with the cards and the yanks he hit three qqq times i am almost sure about this in case anyone is wondering the record for two homer games is held by babe ruth and is qqq mize ' s record may not last for much longer because of juan gonzalez he has at least three games with three and maybe qqq i know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie i do n ' t have any record books at college for me to check on though please let me know okay if i am wrong onto the padres is there anyone out there who follows them especial ly those with access to local news i do n ' t here anything in los angeles and i ca n ' t get mcpaper consistently around here comment it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought bell and plantier to the padres it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann of course plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of qqq but with a lower average bell always could finish with qqq and qqq qqq hrs essentially jerald clark ' s numbers leadoff comment craig shipley i get on base qqq of the time if i ' m lucky at leadoff hell of the usual starters use gwynn he ' s got qqq steals already is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell though i have n ' t seen stillwell ' s name in any box scores anyway unless you are going to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn he at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases sheffield comment though the season is early and stats mean nothing witness phillips batting qqq currently but does sheffield have an injury or anythingelse wrong with him i just do n ' t hear anything andy benes is he pitching like he did in the second half of qqq or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then has anyone seen him pitch the two good games score for today sunday april qqq padres qqq st louis qqq padres sweep the cardinals as gwynn goes qqq for qqq with a homer sheffield and tueful also homer in a winning cause thanks for listening reading any comments ?
no he ' s not nuts wip is second to none the sports station they do n ' t have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday night hockey because they suck i live in richmond va but i visit phila often and on the way i get wtem washington and wip i hear the fan at night wherever i go the signal used to be wnbc when they played golden oldies because you ca n ' t avoid it of those three wip has the best hosts hands down chuck cooperstein is n ' t a homer and neither is jody mac wtem is too generic to be placed in the catergory in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the theme music is identical same ownership i think so wip is totally original their hosts actually have a personality this is a knock at tem the team not the fan because mike and the mad dog and sommers are good i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia to the ones in washington is a total joke anyway i like the fan and wip but i think the edge goes to ip when i get back from philly i go into withdraw cause richmond has nada except the national sports line and those guys are totally clueless i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games wcau is another strong station now it ' s an oldies station but they still have the phillies i started listening to the fan because i heard he went there i finally heard him last summer and he was n ' t the same guy those ny fans got to him i was glad to hear him back in philly when i went to see a few eagles games i will admit i am die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an eagles station qqq days a year but i bet you the phillies are in control right now about the knock on g cobb i like him he knows the eagles like a book i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away cobb said that the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win well they were inches shy of pulling the victory .
yeah valentine how many rings does clemens have nothin like good old fashioned canadian logic btw the only good thing i can say about the jay ' s rotation this year is that it could have been worse stewart might have stayed healthy -
soderstrom plays with philly but he does n ' t have a moulded mask he ' s got the helmet and cage variety in white or at least that ' s what he wore thirteen hours ago .
why not i believe both the devils and islanders got qqq points say for example another team had this record qqq qqq qqq they had qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq which is the same as their points total the islanders and devils records are both qqq qqq qqq it is simple arithmetics and involve no calculus .
grant fuhr has done this to a lot better coaches than brian sutter .
i am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose games are regularly broadcast on an fm station the only one i am aware of is wysp in philadelphia who carries the eagles games if you respond to me i will summarize for the list .
mike vernon is now qqq wins qqq losses plus that all star game debacle in afternoon games during his career with another afternoon game with los angeles next sunday has the abc deal doomed the flames ?
for your information lankford is injured i think it is his shoulder or rib cage so he could not use him as a pinch hitter i do believe that whiten was a very good aquisition for the cards he does not have too much offensive capabilities but he is an awesome defensively since when have the cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense i forgot who st louis gave up for him but it was not too much as far as gilkey is concerned he is a leftfielder and so is brian jordan who beat him out i expect to see a gilkey jordan platoon in lf i agree with you on this one as soon as larkin threw that ball i knew that lankford was a dead bird but how could dent have known that larkin would make a perfect throw i strongly believe that torre is one of the best managers in baseball do n ' t forget the overachieving cards of qqq that won all those close games and went from last place to second place although they were oveshadowed by the braves twins last to first climb he won a division title and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the braves why atlanta ever even considered firing him i will never understand with torre at the controls the cardinals are heading in the right direction one more thing one game does not make a season yes they lost to the reds but with the second best pitching staff in the national league first in the east and a pretty good offense the redbirds will win a lot more than they lose maybe this is the year that they will go all the way charles a very enthusiastic cardnials fan º charles rosen º thirty four to thirteen º º university of alabama º national champs roll tide º º tuscaloosa al º need i say more º

yes a point well taken however even in areas that finally got some games there ' s something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news there ' s an awesome overtime going on in quebec city and we ' ll try to get you an update through the show when you know that it ' s on a satellite ' s feedhorn somewhere up there from today ' s times abc got great ratings in chicago and st louis a qqq and the kings flames got a qqq on the west coast but only a qqq in metro new york i . e the devils squandered their newfound support from a year ago when they played the rangers in comparison seniors golf did better i fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great i ca n ' t tell if abc did any advance marketing or not ' cos i do n ' t watch much tv the nhl should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going on the air even espn could ' ve sold second rights to third party systems i . e non sportschannel since they are not making any extra money by sitting on the games hockey fans will not necessarily be watching pre season beach volleyball if playoffs games are n ' t being shown somewhere gld
last night during a sharks broadcast commissioner bettman was interviewed during the first intermission he made no bones about it the expansion to qqq is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of qqq are fully stable this means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate this is good imo there ' s no sense in expanding if it only means more failing franchises are in the mold .
i dunno lemieux hmmm sounds like he has french blood in him hey france is part of europe send that euro blooded boy back do n ' t you americans study history the french settled in north america as early or before the british lemieux can probably trace back his north american heritage back a lot further than most of us friendly jibe mode on do n ' t you canadians understand sarcasm sometimes the reader must decide that what he ' s reading is so ludicrous that it must mean the opposite of what it said kinda like the toronto ' s going to win the cup posts yeah right and cows can fly friendly jibe mode off geez gerald like anyone reading rec . flamefest . hockey . pens . are . great did n ' t know that le mow was from quebec .
methinks you recall wrong mitchell hit close to qqq in atlanta and continued to walk alot after his promotion he was then i think left off the playoff roster and started the next year in the minors where even the braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad at going back down he struggled last year no doubt but even the braves blamed part of it on the demotion i ' d much rather have mitchell than say mark whiten on the cards .
this is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving espn qqq or qqq years ago it will take time to correct for that mistake but returning to espn was the correct decision last year by next time we may have the potential for sportschannel and espn to really compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it .
one reason that the wha abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play the blue dye that was used somehow affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck decreasing its cohesiveness .
the event that had the most impact on gaetti ' s career was his leg injury in qqq his performance dropped radically from qqq to qqq he was still with the twins in qqq and qqq but if you look at his stats both offensive and defensive he never has come back to his pre injury level .

do n ' t expect to get top quality just some toughness i do n ' t view makarov as a player who would add toughness nelson you ' re confusing skill and toughness hey get off the mcgill hammond thing i ' m no fan of either my point is that last year the sharks had toughness that was missing this year this year we had more skill i ' m all for that but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they ca n ' t do you much good whether it ' s a cheap shot or not you ca n ' t let the other teams push you around the qqq qqq sharks simply got pushed around to much other teams knew this they knew they could aggressively check the sharks and not pay for it adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players or to take cheap shots it does n ' t guarantee no injuries nothing does but it ' s something the sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries mark just say

i do n ' t think primeau is necessarily a bad pick i ' m was just trying to locate the beginning of murray ' s decisions he slowness in trading carson has delayed primeau ' s development and you have to wait longer for big players often and primeau can be a very good player without being a point a game player especially on a team that has yzerman and fedorov if primeau becomes joel otto and gets qqq goals a season and plays mean it will have been an extremely good pick .
then allow me to enlighten you rex you see there ' s a thing called a tie a tie is worth one point i know i know you ' re not good at math but bear with me a win is worth two points so getting two ties is the same as getting one win if your team played two games won one and lost one you ' d have two points if my team played two games and tied them both we ' d also have two points we ' d be tied in the standings even though our records are different perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again i am starting to sound like roger or what )
you know what my answer will be hrivnak the choice is obvious .

lloyd pettit yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for qqq m but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than that he felt that no one would pay qqq m for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that but the market fooled him and qqq teams have been created for qqq m apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams ca n ' t be moved for less than qqq m and i doubt that he could get one for that little pettit gambled and lost now he ' ll have to pay more .

the isles picked one hell of a time to get their first win all year after being down after qqq periods the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci the isles power play philosophy continues to be dump and chase which except for boardaholics like flatley does n ' t work against the caps i hope al realizes this they have too many talented finesse players so why not carry the puck in and set up if last night ' s game is any omen the isles could be on their way to that ole championship form coming from behind late in a game my advice to the caps is to pounce on those healy rebounds flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of dale hunter ray ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an italian from the past john tonelli it was tonelli who won a similar game against the pens in game qqq on the qqq playoffs the isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into ot tied at qqq in ot tonelli scored the game winner to send the isles to the next round the isles have lacked this tenacity for years but perhaps its back it was good to see the coliseum packed just like the ole days good luck to the isles the rest of the way john scialdone scialdone @ nssdca . gsfc . nasa . gov
yep and the ks do n ' t have to denote a slow game either last night sid fernandez was mowing the giants hitters down qqq ks in qqq innings yet the first qqq qqq innings of the game were quite brisk he also threw qqq pitches leading me to believe it is n ' t just the number of pitches that determines the length of a game but the behavior between pitches .
from where i come from in canada borshevsky sounds more canadian than smith anyways crawl back into the hole you crawled out of the nba does n ' t care where they get basketball players from major league baseball does n ' t give a damn where they get baseball players from except cuba that is canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players sweden finland the czech republic and slovakia are all relatively small countries and can not really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them and the potential influx from the former soviet union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two to recover and become a real threat and the us will just maintain its slow increase canada should continue to supply qqq plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future besides we need the european hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports and since soccer is essentially boring unlike hockey canadians are under no threat the european numbers will soon saturate if they have n ' t already and by the time russia comes online again the nhl should be a world league and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for canadian hockey players in the near team the percentage of canadians will mostly decline because of americans not because of europeans crawl into a hole and die .

hey what ' s this we agree no platoon advantage sabo vs samuel both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups sabo has more power and a little bit of a better batting eye samuel is noted as an agressive free swinger sabo has more homerun power both players started the game hitting below qqq there may have been some game considerations that might have prompted perez to want to reserve samuel for use later but the game was on the line and samuel never did get in given all of this i do n ' t see a lot to suggest pinch hitting nor do i see anything to suggest no pinch hitting there is of course the clutch hitting information but if that ' s useless then again if it ' s not .
first i enjoyed reading your post second i disagree with the pen ' s weak spot being defense and goaltending for a couple of reasons barrasso has had a spectacular year no slow start consistently sharp gaa qqq and leads the league in wins tommy deserves the vezina given the lack of respect he commands though i doubt he will win it the other reason concerns the pens team defense they are hovering around qqq or qqq in the fewest goals allowed that is a big improvement for them and it indicates that they are playing better team defense we ' ll see it ' ll be fun .

some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted some thoughts and facts qqq bill james is a partial owner of stats inc however he has almost nothing to do with the day to day operations of the company although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name the handbook but not the scoreboard to the best of my knowledge the only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section of the handbook and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook qqq the debate over elias goes way back bill james early stuff was hampered by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price project scoresheet and later stats were founded to fill this void you can call stats and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database and they will provide it for a price of course or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself having attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past football not baseball they just do n ' t do that in stats eyes the high ground comes from making the information available at all qqq that being said i ' m pretty dissapointed by bill ' s book this year too i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than april hope this makes things just a little bit clearer bias alert i am a former part time employee of stats )

as long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and andersson to report to binghampton it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger organization however is having binghampton win the calder cup really more important to them than keeping their players happy ?

stuff deleted i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument that has great hands means nothing it seems to me that a first baseman ' s defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups how many such chances does he get during a game many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from qqq qqq and p i mean the total of these is much higher than grounder popup totals this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high up the line or in the dirt good hands are needed for such plays and thus have value i do n ' t have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but i ' d guess that the values of these abilities are similar it ' s just like you do n ' t judge catcher ' s defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups but not as marked i suppose .
detroit is a very disciplined team there ' s a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast so toronto would have to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last resort anyway toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players toronto is just an average team detroit is n ' t ballard screwed toronto when he was owner everyone knows that and it ' s going to take time for toronto to become a real force i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year he ca n ' t pull the whole team forever .

frankly no offense and defense are equally important but the pitcher is qqq of the defense the primary role of every other player is on offense even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game they might not do much with their part of the offense but that ' s another issue that being said i think both smith and yount deserve the hof they hit pretty well in addition to their defense .
sorry nelson but you forgot to ask me if you check the thn stats for kansas city you ' ll find that larry has been playing for the games having played in qqq games in the period covered in the stats between qqq and the qqq issue qqq qqq qqq with qqq pim not exactly invisible well having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times this is n ' t quite accurate he injured his back a disk injury and did one stupid thing which was to hide it from the sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble the sharks then sent him to k . c at which point he disclosed the injury since he did n ' t disclose it the sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting that was eventually worked out the sharks re instated him as injured and put him into therapy and when he was able to play then shipped him down to k . c he fully expects to play in the nhl again although clearly not with the sharks hiding injuries is a stupid no no beyond just a no no very nice guy always hustled his butt off he disappeared because he was hurt i expect he ' ll surface with another team at some point probably another expansion team but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated unfortunately he played himself out of the sharks future with a bad judgement call always gave qqq best work ethic on the club except maybe kisio but hustle is n ' t always enough his future with the sharks was made clear to me one night against the flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold joel otto against the board he literally had one arm around otto ' s neck and another wrapped around otto ' s stick arm otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal as though carter was n ' t there hustle can only cover size so far the sharks have told me point blank that he ' s gone for good ditto hubie mcdonough he was one of the favorites of the staff but as one said to me you have to make room for the kids carter in fact refused to report to k . c and has been suspended by the sharks that might be a defacto retirement but i have n ' t heard anything official his only hope in hockey now is the gulls because at least from the games i saw him in he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice i think he shows potential but i did n ' t think he was quite ready to make the jump to the nhl agreed btw i still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish they ' d performed than how they actually performed i wonder whether you can really judge talent from radio and television nelson i know i have trouble since you do n ' t see the off puck action your views from home and my views from the ice differ in numerous ways coffee coffey is with the red wings you nah he was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep however as few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless i hate to judge the talent too quickly butn in dody ' s case i " m tempted to make an exception but i wo n ' t .
bill james is however very closely tied to stats .
major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter attention spans i . e the football crowd invariably all the arguments from people who do n ' t like to watch baseball on t . v say the same thing the games are too long and too boring baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider t . v appeal if you look at it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games the difference is that there is more action in that duration in football games perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you would get more of those fans to tune in anyway coming up with a solution to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since it ' s obvious that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in nebraska off soapbox - steve
buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains pat lafontaine was awarded the captaincy when mike ramsey was forced to give it up ramsey ' s now a penguin ramsey inherited it from mike foligno who ' s now a leaf he in turn had inherited it from lindy ruff who went i forget where ruff had it from perreault who retired so i guess that ' s where the streak started or did it after all danny gare was captain before him and he went to detroit jim scoenfeld gerry meehan and floyd smith are the others in reverse order last to first i was a bit young at the time so i ' m not sure of the fate of schoenfeld but he ultimately went to detroit and boston meehan went to vancouver atlanta and washington smith seems to have hung up his skates after buffalo but i do n ' t know if the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he played for buffalo this is actually getting fascinating captaincy in buffalo is a sure sign you ' re to be traded almost unless you ' re a franchise player .
i agree lumberjack except that they ' re in qqq they are going places san diego los angeles san francisco cincinnati denver atlanta miami philadelphia new york montreal pittsburgh chicago st louis and points in between but they ' re qqq qqq at home i ' m just not used to an overly enthusiastic houston fan i really should n ' t discourage it so hang in there lumberjack but get ahold of that shift key will ya obbase apparently the new owner drayton mclain sp does n ' t particularly like excuses an item in our paper the austin american statesman if you read it here it was somewhere else first said that he would n ' t take injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been accounted for uh oh i do n ' t want an owner that ' ll keep everybody on edge i ' d never gotten that feeling about him but who knows does anybody down there in the houston area have a feel for how meddling of an owner mclain is going to be ?
do n ' t you guys think so i mean c ' mon what the heck are women doing even thinking of getting into baseball they cause so many problems just look at lisa olson remember that feisty reporter that entered the new england patriots locker room she started crying like a little girl i just do n ' t think women belong in a man ' s sport before you smart guys flame me for this i know the given example was about football who cares it still applies to other male sports how can we have women umpires jeez look at pam postema just because she ' s a woman everybody on the face of the earth thinks it ' s great that she ' s getting an opportunity to ump if you even watched the games and had an iq greater than that of roast beef you ' d see that she is not nearly as good as most aaa umpires besides she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of wade boggs bat or jose oquendo ' s bat either way there are too many complications .
during the first three games of the pens devils series i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens jagr maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch but one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman despite brooks lunatic comments and despite the devils line changing adantage in last night ' s game bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark granted the hell dwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night but bowman was eventually able to configure his line up to get the job done his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis last night for instance he realized that the speed of jagr straka and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance as a result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played almost the entire game he was always on the puck and maceachern scored a goal while complementing jagr many times throughout the night his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success .
deletions geez dal must have slipped something into ted ' s drink sometime comparing prince to pagnozzi offensively is laughable prince has never hit well in the minors and he ' s now qqq years old i think pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors i ' ll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming i do n ' t have another brain cramp and forget he had a very good year at louisville before coming up to the majors as i recall the hype on pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit decent fielding when he got to the majors and did n ' t hit as well as expected not as much playing time he became exhibit qqq in nichols law of catcher defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher it ' s not clear he ever learned to hit his four years with more than qqq ab born qqq july qqq year ab ba slg oba qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq no power less than league average walks peak year when he turned qqq now declining if ted is going to invoke pagnozzi as a model for prince given that prince has underperformed pagnozzi in the minors it ' s not a rosy picture btw i ' m still unhappy with moving zeile who had the same reputation coming up in the cardinal organization as pagnozzi except that he was a much much better hitter to qqq where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well above average hitter as an average or below average fielding catcher harold
so what does that have to do with rbi ' s the team with the most rbi ' s does n ' t necessarily win the game yes runs are the most important statistice for a team so why does every newspaper rank team offense by batting average but for an individual player runs and rbis are context dependent and tell us very little about the player himself and more about his teammates and position in the batting order .
how does one read the betting spreads for baseball they tend to be something like qqq qqq which means it must not be runs that spread means you bet qqq on the underdog to win qqq or qqq on the favorite to win qqq .
well had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions the responses would probably have been a bit more measured be that as it may clemens is always in this form and viola is n ' t really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected how do you know that the sox are responding to them and not to al bumbry hobson or my most likely suspect new hitting coach mike easler i certainly am more likely to give easler credit for mo vaughhn ' s hot start than clemens or viola this was the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so he has n ' t shown much power yet though how can you tell that dawson is providing the leadership perhaps it ' s calderon perhaps it ' s clemens and viola maybe hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him or maybe it ' s all a myth and dawson has been hitting reasonably well but not as well as greenwell vaughn cooper or fletcher in three games why do n ' t we look at this one again in say july a bit better than could reasonably have been expected but do n ' t forget that zupcic looked like wade boggs lite for about qqq ab ' s last year beware of small sample sizes still if fletcher hits as well as he did last year he ' d be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he does n ' t have to make more than qqq ab or so in a year ummm sorry no i can buy the in the field part and i think he ' ll be better at the plate than the qqq boggs but in general cooper while he ' ll be a pretty good hitter could n ' t carry boggs jockstrap with a little luck he could be the fourth or fifth best qqq in the al martinez boggs ventura and palmer will all be better see here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether qqq is plausible third is not unlikely but phrases like could run away with the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats it ' s not really clear that their staff is better than last year if russell does well darwin does n ' t go on the dl and hesketh does n ' t pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation they could be better on the other hand if hesketh pitches miserably and they ' re too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he ' s a lefty and russell explodes they could be pretty bad mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com

and it is not hirschbeck ' s job to help gant with any of these difficulties if gant ca n ' t gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes him all the more meat in the batter ' s box the umpire ' s job is to maintain flow of play gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties nor is anyone else absolutely i think it ' d be more accurate to say gant was foolish if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last about nine fifteen weeks if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were pitching a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the blue they ' re not going to change their mind and you ' re just going to come across as a pinhead which wo n ' t help you with the borderline calls ftr i never speak to umpires when i do n ' t know them personally nor do i glance at them or react to calls as a result i think i get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because i have a rep of having a good eye actually there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about my masculinity party affiliation and sexual preference irrelevant he was wasting time then qqq because it ' s not his job qqq because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily extend to those qqq hour games kind of like the phantom dp gant hurt himself and the braves disrupted the game your biases are exposed and i ' m sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura jack kevorkian and the swedish abortion team i believe terry said the magic word there are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame for a primer email me good ways to get tossed from a game qqq ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri system qqq kiss rich garcia on the lips and say hi honey i ' m home qqq goose eric gregg qqq ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived qqq get naked source the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette as told to peter gammons qqq collier press )
i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip ( i go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis now that the fan has mike lupica on from qqq to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he had bob costas and magic johnson on too now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show qqq am to qqq noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host qqq noon to qqq pm at this point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base this is most evident when the iggles ( philadelphia spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a qqq qqq score without the egging of the hosts ( re wip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin if you are in ny and you ca n ' t get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes qqq to qqq this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and russo ( fatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even qqq to qqq minutes without talking about sports matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the qqq to qqq debate another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious qqq pm to qqq pm matd go up against fredericks and missanelli i like mike missanelli but i just ca n ' t stomach steve fredericks i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now i do n ' t listen to wip much after qqq pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the reason that is why i give the advantage to fan qqq pm to midnight s & m are on wip until qqq and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nuts ( i know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st john ' s basketball if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysp ( home of howard stern in phil during the summer it is all talk on wip overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of qqq to qqq and qqq to qqq where it is even and qqq to qqq where wip has the advantage rich

most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times my opinion fwiw to all mark age does n ' t matter ability does i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best i do n ' t care if he is qqq if he plays better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher i ' ll admit santiago ' s numbers would probably come out the same as sandy ' s but i do n ' t have the league data from the qqq to check it out that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the qqq lopez is real olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around qqq if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in qqq or santiago in qqq one year at any level at any age does n ' t satisfy my standards of evidence javier lopez qqq qqq bur qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq dur qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq grn qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq on a similar note i do n ' t understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush last year was the first time he ever got qqq ab in one place so his lines are hard to read but he has a combined qqq ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age qqq had a monster year with an qqq ops he has a total major and minor eqa of qqq above major league average and above average for cf which was about qqq in the nl last year he has shown at least the potential of going into the qqq which would make him one of the qqq best hitters in the league he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of qqq he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple side show attraction deion sanders qqq qqq fla qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq eas qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq nyy qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq nyy qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ric qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball for anyone who did n ' t see sunday ' s game with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a qqq hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a qqq hitter with no power as a pinch hitter what the hell is he thinking earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench gilkey hit over qqq last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home i ca n ' t take this anymore brian a very distressed cardinal fan -

we ' re probably stuck as mike burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the nhl contract wabc did the same thing they were thankful that the devils were wiped out by qqq because they had to switch over to yankees baseball the proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader it ' s too bad but i wonder if espn is stuck with other us local team coverage for their alternate games we got nesn ' s coverage of the bruins sabres with the boston homers they were awful i ' ve read that derek sanderson is the colour analyst i wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at pravda before landing this job everything had to be twisted into something good to say about the bruin ( s involved not even bill wirtz ' s shills on sc chicago pat foley dale tallon were this bad and just to be fair sc used to take their feed from esn empire sports network the sabre homers and they were horrible too but they were spacy from the cnn highlights i hear chris cuthbert ' s voice from the cbc coverage of the habs nords series too bad that we could n ' t get it on espn with all due respect to the sabres and the bruins mike emrick is substituting on the devils scny team for gary thorne mike was the original devils tv play by play announcer by the way gld

the real way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on both teams for all players who participated in the game offer qqq for each qqq minutes less than qqq hours the game took i . e if the game only took qqq hours each player gets a bonus of qqq for all pitchers throwing qqq or more full innings in the game extrapolate the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have thrown in a full qqq innings and offer qqq for each number less than qqq if the pitcher throws a complete game with qqq pitches and qqq throws to first he would get qqq i suspect you could finance this the same way presidential campaigns are paid for offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says i want qqq of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses .

gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one if they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges it is like me telling you that felix potvin is n ' t very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of him sure lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player for a team to be successful they need to have all types of players this includes defensive forwards when compared with other defensive forwards bob gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever he is the player who ' s talents best suited being a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he was n ' t bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey .

nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts i suspect that nesn was only going to sell one telecast to espn remember espn only owns exclusive rights to the finals not the entire playoffs since espn bought the sca contract there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils and penguins i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc same exact coverage as last week pit nj game qqq in the east chi stl in the central la cgy in the mountains and west .
i think there is another formula for era i heard something about it last year i m not sure what it is but i m gon na give it a stab it allows for a pitcher to pitch more than qqq innings at a time and not benefit cuz it uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched era qqq recorded like i said i m not sure this is exactly it but i m pretty sure they changed it to something of the sort .

finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway in world champs after two periods the score was still qqq qqq this game was quite much similar to the first game finland played against france the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too in the third period juha riihij { rvi scored qqq qqq from a rebound the time was around qqq mins or so the second goal was scored by kari harila who shot straight from a faceoff behind the nowwegian goalie saku koivu the qqq old center got his first point of this tournament saku koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game prize despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater i think that we will hear from this guy in the future .
i believe that rusty staub was also a jewish ball player also mordaci brown back in the early qqq century he was a pitcher whose nickname was qqq fingers brown for obvious reasons he had qqq fingers qqq for qqq qqq daniel patrick staub is a catholic school kid from nawlins mordecai brown a farm kid probably protestant from somewhere in the midwest he lost those fingers in a farm machinery accident jim palmer is n ' t jewish himself but mr jockey shorts ' s adoptive parents are also i ' m not absolutely certain that carew actually converted his wife and children certainly are jewish -
close but there ' s a number qqq also qqq have entered the game with no more than a qqq run lead and pitched at least one inning if a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won does not get the win and satisfies at least one of the three requirements he gets a save - rusty -
as far as i know toronto pittsburgh and new york nl change their uniforms every year every other year e . g new york it will say mets in cursive new york in cursive or new york in all caps minor changes but they do change them often last year i think they had new york in all caps did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year what about pittsburgh i hate the gray they should opt for more color like the white sox i hate white team versus gray team spring training uniforms look much better .
the answer is in the faq for this group nough said .
i agree with nick what ' s the big deal about long games if you want to watch baseball there ' s that much more baseball to watch and yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves i suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games especially when it ' s coming from tv people has to something to do with advertising probably time wasted in the middle of an inning say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts could otherwise be sold as advertising time .

matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a qqq old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a qqq qqq million contract risebrough matched the offer on king ' s request and makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks not to mention that he ' s lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract he ' s ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if there ' s no takers and makarov does n ' t show improvement in training camp i think the flames will just bite the bullet and buy out makarov ' s contract and release him with his current attitude he is a detriment to the team .

nonsense i quite clearly state that it was greg that made the claim that gainey never made an error and he made the claim read below from rec . sport . hockey thu apr qqq qqq qqq from gballent @ hudson uvic ca greg ballentine message id qqq uvic ca nonsense deleted gainey is the best defensive forward ever i stand by that assessment he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame did you ever watch him play he never made a technical error more nonsense deleted to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious your hockey education is not my responsibility he was just another player to laud him as anything more i find bothersome i hated the habs i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever skate in my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey did he play hockey at a high level was he any good if not why would you bother to bring jc up i am talking about hockey players here if you ca n ' t follow the conversation do n ' t follow up as i said previously it is not my responsibility to educate you sure two journeymen big deal neither one of them is worth discussing that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or greg ' s postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god and greg ate it up and that is what this thread is all about if you did n ' t know that then why are you responding and as for blanket disregard for these individuals i can remember leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four stanley cups teams no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world right i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were a complete joke in the future if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize cordially as always rm
wales conference adams division semifinal i ' m hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilny lafontaine vs oates juneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact he ' s one of my favourites even though he ' s a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six agreed here but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final i ca n ' t predict a montreal victory because i ' ve been watching them play for qqq weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b ' s qqq qqq but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roy ' s at the same time i ca n ' t bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i ' ll just say i will not be putting money on this series agreed ny does n ' t have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i do n ' t think it will go six either * maybe five if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wo n ' t be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven it _ will _ be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they do n ' t use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered qqq qqq by a team chasing them calgary winnipeg in six this is also tough for me to call because i have n ' t seen the smythe enough i do n ' t think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a non issue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be la winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice wow must ' ve been tough to go against your team but let ' s see i picked la detroit detroit will win probably in six if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would n ' t bet against the wings they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because they ' ve been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i ' d have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i ' m not asking for flames either btw i ' ve spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he ' s a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best all round players in the nhl .
i ' d like to echo these sentiments this is the worst coverage i can ever remember seeing on cbc as soon as the game ends i can count to qqq and by that time they ' ve signed off the air no post game interviews no updating of late scores nothin tsn is really putting cbc to shame i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey my qqq darren

i did n ' t mean to offend or anything i ' m just quoting stanky himself on the subject i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by espn and the interviewer ca n ' t remember who asked stanky if he was jewish because he the interviewer was jewish and wanted to see more jewish ballplayers to which stanky replied i ' m polish not jewish so maybe that was n ' t the most pc thing for stanky to say and maybe i was a little naive when i posted it i think we should just devote this subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers i myself am jewish and the only ones i ever knew until now were koufax greenberg and blomberg .

i ' m a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma i ' m hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas i ' ve been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the u . s so why is the team moving to a city in texas is it that the owner is a greedy self serving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging as much as i ' d like to see the nhl only a qqq hour drive from me i ca n ' t help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly did n ' t support the team opinions please .

my father is a huge tiger fan and i am a loyal blue jay fan who endured the collapse of qqq the heartbreak of qqq i do n ' t have the stat book so let ' s throw them out first of all morris in his heyday qqq qqq vs clemens qqq how many cy youngs does morris have how many cy youngs does clemens have ballparks and such fenway average pitchers park detroit hugh hitters paradise morris is a great team pitcher sort of in the doug drabek mold if morris ' s team needs a well pitched game as in minn in qqq morris snaps the ball and throw for ks otherwise he just tries to get people out as for clemens in the elias stat book of qqq i believe that clemens has the best lifetime record for his team as compared to when he does n ' t pitch how bad would the red sox have been last year without him can you say qqq phillies i believe clemens is the better pitcher because of more power and hsi great tenacity morris is among the guttiest pitchers i ; ve ever seen but clemens is in a class with seaver carlton etc .
i ' m not sure i understand this question when the if rule is invoked the batter is automatically out this relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught other than that is n ' t it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball that is if the ball is caught he can tag up and run or decide to stay and if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time .

that would be clint malarchuck it was speculated at the time that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked he never would have survived ditto if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby if you ' ve seen video tape of the incident it is amazing how much blood there was it was literally spurting out all over the ice as clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror amazingly enough he made a full recovery and played again in the nhl he was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway and did n ' t play for too long afterward some people speculated that he just could n ' t get himself back together after the incident and i think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward he did eventually get back to form and played another year or so after that and then i believe he retired anyone else carol boudreau qqq a . k . a the x terminator boudreau @ athena . mit . edu go flames rock the kings !

npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy name possibly garbled by me an official historian for the cia she has won an emmy for research on moe berg for a tv documentary which i know from nothing but which sounds good she said that among other things berg was the principal spy for the oss cia ' s wwii precursor spying on axis atomic programs because of his physics background and language skills she said that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland and had instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb research he concluded they were two years behind and did n ' t shoot him i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb program but i do n ' t know how reliable this is unfortunately npr did n ' t mention any kind of a book she ' s writing i ' d certainly buy it in case you ' re wondering about baseball relevance berg was a longtime mlb backup catcher he was a member of an mlb all star team that toured japan in qqq presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few americans much less mlb players who spoke japanese photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids according to mccarthy )

how about kevin hatcher scored roughly qqq goals plays qqq minutes a game that ' s really sad when two second rate goalies barasso and belfour are the main contenders for the vezina call me crazy but how about tommy soderstrom five shutouts for a qqq place team that does n ' t really play defense it ' s really unfortunate that the better goalies in the league mclean essensa vernon had unspectacular years btw if you are going to award the norris on the basis of the last qqq days why not give the vezina to moog he has been the best goalie over the past month arbour or king burns will probably win since playoffs are n ' t taken into consideration he ' s ok in the regular season but i ' m not sure if he ' s beaten anyone other than hartford in the playoffs .

espn has been trying various things to get away from the follow the puck concept of televising hockey games one of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso ' s on football players to be shown between plays the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile other times you get burned .
there is a great book out called they also served which is about the ballplayers during wwii there is some info on berg in there it also has info on pete gray one armed outfielder and other players of the era because of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the draft for medical reasons there are some very interesting stories in the book it is very well written and i would suggest reading it to anyone with an interest in baseball rob koffler
yes colin i have to agree with you here i ' ve put the puck in my own net the same way smith did only once mind you and it was definitely my fault it is not a common play to play the puck the way that smith did luckily for me when i did it it was only a scrimmage )
m were doomed to qqq in the division i ' m still not convinced the m sabres will win this series i ' ve lived in buffalo all my life and m these last qqq years have been playoff hell but i ' m just sitting m back crossing my fingers and hoping the offense can keep scoring have no fear doug the bruins are toast statistically only qqq teams in all the stanley cup series ever played have come back to win and it could n ' t have happened to a nicer team with all the crowing from boston fans i ' ve had to endure over the last month take heart bruins fans at least you finished first in the adams sinister chuckle jack laugh and the world thinks you ' re an idiot .
these players all are pretty good players they are the depth that the dynasties had to win stanley cups they tend to be the very good second line guys who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the nhl they were all important to their clubs probably several of these stanley cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players they compare to rick tocchet and ron francis of the penguins very good players who can lead lesser teams francis hartford tocchet philly who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the nhl as a defensive forward there have been none better than bob gainey that does n ' t mean he was the best player or even the best forward the canadians had at that time but he was excellent at what he did gainey could dominate games with his defence he did n ' t need to get goals to dominate he shut down the opposition and was thus valuable there has never been anyone any better at doing this not ever .
do you notice that _ nobody _ on the team is willing to take charge a dominant defenceman would be nice too bad schneider got hurt he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes speaking of chelios i wonder if serge savard feels like a moron for making that trade i also wish we still had corson rob ramage on the ice is less useful than a gatorade bottle on the bench vincent damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently i have no idea why demers is playing denis savard on the checking line with carbonneau savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous canadiens in quebec ' s zone with the puck too bad nobody is in front most of the time do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single nordique gets knocked down it ' s disgusting we also have lebeau qqq qqq getting pasted at centre ice by wolaninn qqq qqq with no reply from the team except to yell for a penalty dammit denis savard threw the best only montreal hit of the night when he knocked sundin off balance when denis savard is your team ' s enforcer there ' s big trouble someplace aside from that second goal roy did stand on his head the third period at least provided something to look forward to habs won the period imo and i guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at qqq hopefully they play that way at home roy made the saves we ' ll ignore that second goal so now it ' s up to the team dchhabra @ stpl . ists . ca

hi baseball fans so what do you say do n ' t you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why do n ' t we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today ' s standards marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount do n ' t belong there they ' re both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal let ' s be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something is n ' t done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan ?
was the abc coverage of the kings flames game supposed to be the way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage when i flipped to abc it was the same commentators same commercials even my question is was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just black out the abc coverage for its own comment cbc had a great chance for some double headers toronto detroit and vancouver winnipeg but today they said that the east gets the leafs and the west get the vancouver game i thought that they would show them both .
i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than kingman ' s probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman ' s both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfield ' s just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered aaron ' s home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player steve garvey i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some qqq records maybe they were not all good i do n ' t know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top qqq but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments no hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes so in summing up i have qqq groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying do n ' t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go yes winfield yount brett ( not in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions .

the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year with mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth the tiger bats will bang this summer already they have scored qqq runs in two games and with fielder tettleton and deer i think they can win the division no pitching bull gully moore wells and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games then there is henneman to close it out watch out boston toronto and baltimore the motor city kittys are back nice woofing or should i say meowing and yes the tiggers are a fun exciting team that i would pay to see but last year they went qqq qqq this year their offense is essentially the same and their pitching is at best essentially the same so why do you think they will suddenly improve to win the qqq or so games which will be required to win the a . l east what has changed that i do n ' t see remember a qqq qqq win is worth as much in the standings as a qqq qqq win .
learn what i know that qqq million dollars is a lot of money i know rickey henderson does n ' t have a career out of baseball i know if he did n ' t have baseball he would n ' t be making near the money he is now i just do n ' t understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough if nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting the a ' s will still win without him remeber many of these athletes have nothing if not for their athletic ability nothing they are getting paid much more than most hard working citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay .

qqq having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get more good pitches to hit this is important since he struggles so much with breaking balls opposing pitchers do n ' t want to walk williams to get to bonds i have to wonder if this good hitter behind you argument is really valid has anyone done a study on this you want a study look at matt williams the year after mitchell was gone look no further not a scientific study but it ' ll show the truth for matt besides bonds _ wants _ to bat qqq i had thought that williams batted after mitchell would n ' t that show that williams does better at qqq rather than qqq the point is moot though becase clark pretty much demands to be qqq and like you point out bonds does like to bat qqq the only person left to bat qqq is williams .
rogers is the one batter lefty in the bullpen dusty has also said he trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is unavailable so you might see a couple of saves for kevin then again if any of the regular rotation falters rogers is a possible candidate to start though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well in an emergency start .

golly i love stupid people listen rex this is hockey the nhl to be precise and in the nhl there exist these things called ties a tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal each team gets one point for a tie there also exits these things called wins a win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent oh yeah only two teams play each other at a time so i can say the opponent a team gets two points for a win so let ' s say that a team has a record of qqq wins qqq losses and qqq ties another team has a record of qqq wins qqq losses and qqq ties the first team has qqq qqq qqq points the second team has qqq qqq qqq points wow they both have the same number of points but the number of wins is different how did they do that that ' s amazing so rex when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker well then that ' s what it means in our example the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the better record even though both teams had the same number of points if you did n ' t understand this post rex maybe you should go back and read it again very slowly keith keller let ' s go rangers let ' s go quakers kkeller @ mail . sas . upenn . edu ivy league champs !

hi guys what happened qqq potvin did n ' t let six goals by qqq wendel and andreychuk woke up qqq home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs the emotional edge qqq refs calls especially last night tended to favour leafs a couple of comments qqq on gilmour just because the guy is n ' t one of the three stars does n ' t mean he was not leading the team someone posted the playoff point total and he ' s in something like fifth or sixth place plus he walked away with the molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular season qqq on the officiating i ' ve heard gripes from both ends on this one emotions are very high in this series the rivalry is one of the stronger ones i know of i do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro leaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on gilmour ' s hand qqq in general i still think detroit has one of the better chances vs pittsburgh though i think the leafs would do better against the blues but not as well if they made it out of the division problem is i like both these teams though i ' m supporting the leafs on the underdog principle d by the way gilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not playing aggressive hockey by the way i ' m not any sort of expert nor do i claim to be i just like watching a good matchup .

mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win .

well since the oilers did n ' t win a heck of a lot of games i ' m not sure they deserve and mvp ca n ' t win without him however i ' d suggest kelly buchberger instead of dave manson who has had a brutal year his pick for the all star game notwithstanding as for biggest surprise i ' d say that buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his breakthrough year for him last year so he did n ' t really raise his game my suggestion would be shjon podein one of the callups from cape breton during the year he was quite far down on the depth chart in the oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on the team he has qqq goals in his qqq games and is only qqq those are decent numbers for a third line player who was seemingly doomed to minor league oblivion the oilers coaching staff likens his style to john tonelli i think he ' ll be on the full time roster next year as for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the oilers dumped for lousy production this year nicholls gilchrist tikkanen or even shayne corson but mellanby is n ' t far off andrew scott andrew @ idacom . hp . com hp idacom telecom division qqq qqq qqq ext qqq

every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being qqq offense qqq defense a run scored is just as important as a run prevented this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what percent is fielding i ' d really like to know btw sherri thanks for the da data i find it fascinating one of the chapters in palmer and thorn ' s hidden game is titled pitching is qqq of baseball implying that fielding is qqq how do they determine that beats me it ' s been a long long time since i read it one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around qqq and qqq -

these people were very silly any team that gets to the world series can win the world series and anybody who ever expects a sweep is crazy if you put the best team in baseball in the series against the worst team in baseball the worst team would win at least a game most of the time and very well could win the series though the odds would certainly be against them .
according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include qqq season series qqq goals against qqq goals for in this order correct me if i ' m wrong anyone have anything to add craig
i think what bob is describing here is a game which mad magazine called basebrawl i have no idea what issue but it sure did cover the violence issue paul
sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk i ' ve seen in a while a the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now nobody was even vaguely interested b several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince who was out of options c lavalliere ' s release had nothing to do with him being through he was released because in the event of an injury to slaught lavalliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday catcher since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties the offense should actually improve with this move .
i did not write that in fact those statements were a rebuttal to an earlier posting that i made and this was culled from my strong rebuttal to those statements please slander shame after the game it ' s no big deal after the employees leave the workplace it does n ' t matter what they say about the boss or the company puhlease first it ' s ross porter second i am really tired of seeing the kind of response that indicates that all i do is parrot what some media person says or writes i have a brain if i choose to characterize something in a certain fashion it ' s because that is what i believe to be accurate it is not just because some unnamed mediot made the characterization i did not brand darryl ' s response as petulant because i never heard any response from darryl i did call him a name i referred to him as a primadonna someone else concluded that i did that because i hate him i do n ' t hate him i think he ' s a primadonna if you disagree fine but stop putting words in my mouth the beastmaster
ok but have you seen tabaracci play yet in his two starts and his relief effort for beaupre he has looked mighty sharp do n ' t forget the shutout i think he ' s let in just four goals over eight periods of play i like hrivnak but we might actually have to give some credit to david poile for a change after this trade hopefully if tabaracci starts against the isles tonight i have n ' t jinxed him .
melido came off the dl today and will start tonight against the rangers now if only he can go the distance so that the bullpen does n ' t have to come in - i ' m outta here like vladimir - alan sepinwall
of course penalties will have to be changed roughing chauvanistic males being aggressive slashing chauvanistic males venting frustration fighting proof that males can not cope with their feelings no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties qqq foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick if you get qqq you are out for the game qqq unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined qqq technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets qqq penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if he she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it oh one other rule when a goal is scored qqq qqq times a period the play can not resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free throw shooting contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their routines at least qqq qqq times during the game and not just between periods either there is a whistle every qqq seconds on average maybe less the game is qqq minutes with qqq minutes between quarters qqq qqq and qqq qqq and a qqq minute halftime and it still takes over qqq hours the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then it truly is a sad day enough for now .
just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers one of my least favorite in la sweet also the mets my other least favorite team loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training the runners lob will be lower this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeile ' s off year i do n ' t know why all the fuss about the fillies the media and all the filly fans on r . s . b forget who is right behind them in the standings give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we ' ll see who is in first then i believe the cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference on a side note a few years ago qqq qqq a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the dodger defense he was asked where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair i remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in go redbirds !

catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead a catcher ' s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years the rule does n ' t apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he ca n ' t hit are n ' t they the same thing either that or just stupidity of course one could make the same sort of argument in other cases pete rose in pursuing ty cobb ' s record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis that may be good business but that does n ' t mean i do n ' t loathe them for it .

argument over reasonable players and umpires deleted yes but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a strike there was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal once he called it a strike the call could not be changed i thought that the umpire did the right thing .

and you wrote an excellent report about it i understand from an unreliable source that canseco was considered expendable by the a ' s when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance the a ' s brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque that ' s a paraphrase of what i remember in any event canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance and the a ' s began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power apparently you sound like larussa the a ' s also objected about this again i ' m just repeating something i heard but possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that the beastmaster

i do n ' t really mind the length of games either if they want to speed the games up in sensible ways that ' s fine with me too however what i object to is the assertion by baseball people whitey herzog buck rodgers are who i ' ve heard say this that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to be expanded .

right most definitely this may be the root of the confusion please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand suppose we have a simplified lotto game you pick a number from qqq qqq and win if that number is drawn suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week in the first year of the game approximately qqq of the population will win qqq or more times in the second year of the game qqq of those qqq winners will again be qqq winners in the third year of the game qqq of those who won qqq or more times in each of the first two years will win qqq again suppose i started with qqq people in my population after three years i have qqq people who have consistently in each of the last three years won qqq or more the number of times expected do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game no because we know there is no skill involved nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of winning but suppose we do n ' t know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or something how would we test this hypothesis we can look for correlations in the population now most of the population will show zero correlation but our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they are n ' t very good psychics they should still manage to win qqq or more times most years net result a small positive correlation over the entire population well zero correlation is zero correlation you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last qqq years but if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent the length of the streak does n ' t seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks now if it were true that qqq of all three year streaks remained true to form then we might have something useful but then we would n ' t have zero correlation instead we have qqq of all three year streaks remain true to form and qqq of all three year streaks reverse you look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split qqq qqq each way then we would have something useful and we would also have a positive correlation but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses .

do n ' t let this confuse anybody the winnipeg jets have never won the stanley cup or even come that close these stanley cup championships go back a long way to about the turn of the century the winnipeg victorias won one or more of these cups the jets did n ' t win any of them can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more stanley cups around the turn of the century lets face facts the canucks are leading the series qqq qqq the canucks dominated the jets in their season series the canucks did better in the regular season than winnipeg who is the better team i think that the facts show that vancouver is better than winnipeg .

the selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored not to score them when lemieux or gilmour play their number one purpose is to score defence is secondary especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one that is why they are not selke candidates someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation it was a few months ago whoever this was please repost it gainey is the best defensive forward ever i stand by that assessment he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame did you ever watch him play he never made a technical error babbling deleted who are these pundits gilmour was good with st louis but he was not the best two way player in the game when he was with them you have overhyped gilmour on this net for months he is a very good forward but hardly the best in the nhl .

well the patrick division got a little more interesting last night the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens that means if the isles beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest first of all with the islanders back to back lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that the islanders are out of shape these guys always suck wind in the qqq period come on a little in the qqq and run out of gas too soon it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost anyway the games was pretty wide open the isles still have tons of trouble scoring the whalers played a golie in is qqq nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles like i mentioned before this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot i say it ' s because the isles do n ' t shoot correctly has anyone else noticed this also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap and he ' s a defenseman he ' s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus this guy gets beaten all the time why the need for such enforcers not only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game i ' ll be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when it ' s called for you know when a guy checks the goalie too hard in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the qqq and ot i mean come on already i ' m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the referee does n ' t call it ot and late in the qqq should be a time for strategy not physical prowess trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you do n ' t deserve to win in the first place just my honest opinion ,
no i do not find this conceivable i also can not conceive of the possibility that there is any hypothetical team which morris would help more than clemens given your premise yes but you are alone in your ability to conceive of that premise .
yes but a we were talking about peak level not career averages and b clemente was the best fielding rf of all time as far as anyone can tell i did a quick scan last night looking for players with a peak comparable to or better than winfield in my quick n dirty subjective judgement you could make good cases for ruth aaron ott robinson clemente kaline maris klein jackson waner and probably a few others this is not a knock on winfield but a comment on his consistency all of those other players had awesome stretches and very good stretches while winfield has been more uniformly excellent hall of fame absolutely qqq peak i ' m not so sure top qqq total career value yes almost certainly .
i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while it ' s true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it was n ' t for grant fuhr the series would now be tied qqq qqq he virtually stole games qqq and qqq for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game qqq fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied qqq qqq even in game qqq when the sabres won qqq qqq the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it had n ' t been for fuhr the sabres would n ' t have been up qqq qqq i think it was through the qqq period and the bruins would n ' t have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog gary
i thought that was sandy koufax .
hell the orioles opening day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with qqq seats but unfortunely the yards a definitely excellent ballpark only holds like qqq with qqq sro spots ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year it ' s a extremely likelyhood that the o ' s could sell out every game this year especially if we lead the division for most of the year like qqq on another front the sale of the orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon eli jacobs who is major debt apparently maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter fernando has made the o ' s as the fifth starter the o ' s pitching staff looks pretty good sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes and fernando baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive al east _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ second to last day of the season gregg the true wild thing olson uncorks a wild pitch allowing the blue jays to tie blue jays win in the qqq and ends the baby birds miracle season of qqq .
i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils actually i am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved however i am going to put an end to non pittsburghers relief with a bit of praise for the pens man they are killing those devils worse than i thought jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats he is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final regular season game pens rule !
i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jersey pitt series show the shots not the hits on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot they panned back to show the rebound maybe mom ' s camera people were a little more experienced joseph stiehm exactly that is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far follow that damn puck ravi shah shah @ pitt . edu
does anyone know where billy taylor is richmond or syracuse he was taken by the jays in the rule v draft but not kept on the roster baseball weekly said that he was demoted to syracuse but a toronto paper indicated that the braves took him back is there an atlanta fan or anyone reading this who knows ?
as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon dropping a qqq qqq decision to the la kings most of the flames neglected to show up especially in their own zone as the kings hit at least five posts the flames best line was probably skrudland paslawski berube which tells how bad the flames were gary suter scored a great goal in fact all three flame goals were scored by d men yawney and dahlquist getting the others but also made some bonehead plays for the kings pat conacher was especially impressive the games was very chippy as dan mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it there were high sticks cross checks punches hits from behind fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out warren rychel from behind flames dominated the game physically but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses i do n ' t think vernon can be blamed for any of the goals calgary went with qqq d men as roger johansson played lw he looked lost imho i hope king inserts chris lindbergh paul kruse or sergei makarov for wednesday ' s game gretzky left the game in the qqq period with a charley horse no idea how serious he did n ' t return i still think the flames should win this series but they better buckle down .
just heard on the news that mike keenan formerly of the blackhawks flyers and general of a siberian prison has just signed to coach the rangers the rangers who won the president ' s cup last year have slipped just a bit at the end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly flyers the flyers fans are going to be disappointed on keenans decision because they were very interested in him oh well go caps connin
you are absolutely correct braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners correct me if i am wrong but qqq or qqq years ago you could nt give away a ticket to see the braves play i would bet my next paycheck that qqq of the so called braves fans living outside of georgia at the present time can not name more than qqq players from their qqq season on the other hand ask any cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name qqq players from any given year and qqq of them probably could granted the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park but that does not mean they diserve the title america ' s team the only reason they are considered america ' s team is because of ted turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation i ' ll consider toronto america ' s team before the braves go reds !

i was hoping somebody would mention clutch clutch baerga the two words simply do not go together with runners in scoring position baerga batted qqq last year this does n ' t quite suck but most batters hit better in this situation alomar he hit qqq with runners in scoring position the difference alomar had qqq rbis in qqq such ab baerga had qqq rbis in qqq such ab baerga got qqq more chances yet succeeded only qqq more times frankly i do n ' t believe in clutch but if i did my vote would go to alomar for mvp let alone best qqq in the al .
yes it ' s a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country being a north stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last qqq years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities within the next five years even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the north stars move .
lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm deleted randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league i think quinn is one of several who are better when quinn took over vancouver several years ago not last year they regularily missed the playoffs i ca n ' t recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did quinn has improved the team from non playoff calibre to a serious contender when murray took over in detroit the were about a qqq team that was a contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup contender so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm quinn is one example of a better gm than murray .
the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage the provincial government is months away from a provincial election it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price and it is before the nhl ' s new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue sharing pocklington is many things stupid is not one of them he can dictate terms because other cities will pay his price if edmonton does n ' t edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and surrendered supremacy to calgary and over the next few years edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too because northlands wants to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing however in this case about the long term financial viability of the oilers the fact is that pocklington is basically right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money sather has done his job the oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon al strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in canada in a post mortem of the oilers season in the globe and mail recently agrees with me )

mvp biggest biggest suprise disappointment los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise they did expect that he would become a great defenseman but i do n ' t think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his rookie year his speed skating ability and puck control is exceptional he is the one to watch on the kings i agree with marty mcsorely and warren rychel running a close second and third i am surprised more people have not noted knickle as the biggest surprise even though i personally do not really rate him well the biggest disappointment has to be carson though this is really unfair since too much was expected of him the second biggest disappointment is melrose with his adolescent handling of the goaltending problems putting hrudey on the bench for a month is just stupid it did not contribute to the team coming out of its slump mvp is surely robitaille .
i thought bill james latest book completely and totally sucked i bought it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly looking at it first what tripe the book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis james claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value not only that but i got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it to say i was disappointed is a grand understatement .
this is the crux of the argument to me at least both the sdcn and the non sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher ' s defense is basically nonmeasurable at present you can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher ' s rank in defense looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher as far as i can tell he does n ' t have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time i ca n ' t see how repetitions at aaa are any better then reps in the majors all we ' re left with is the calling the game aspect olsen and berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff but this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn the major league pitching staff the only way any catcher is going to learn tom glavine ' s pitches is to catch tom glavine similarly i would n ' t be supprised if the pitcher ' s claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen but given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez now since lopez ca n ' t learn how to handle the major league pitcher ' s while he ' s in aaa and since he does n ' t have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he ca n ' t learn just as well while in the majors ?

i like alomar but i ' d like to differ with your opinion about a city which is likely to pour in the votes i attended many games last year during the balloting i know that a great number of the attendees did not fill out their ballots but left them beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the all star game unfortunately this is not a one time thing i ' ve attended games during the last four seasons and it has happened every time the apathetic attitude to all star ballots really offends me .
did anyone see the montreal quebec game yesterday it was tight right down to the last second of the third period in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods ok so montreal won they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick their second goal in overtime was also replayed but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick anyways montreal is back into the series .

amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are not machines cy young winners do n ' t pitch in a vaccuum unaware of how their offenses are doing the braves pitching staff is already showing signs of cracking under the strain of knowing they ' re not going to get many if any runs unfortunately the braves pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress and i mean stress on pitching that they completely ignored hitting the braves right now are looking woefully similar to the braves of the mid seventies heaven help us .

hey american hockey fans as a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel the problem is that other americans do n ' t give a shit about hockey they view it as a bunch of canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two thirds of the us to see the stuff naturally on the other hand baseball is the gasp * swoon * sigh national pasttime baseball is so romanticized in the us that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after april qqq and before november qqq i feel that since espn shows qqq baseball games a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead of the opening innings of a baseball game hell the game is going to last qqq qqq so what if you miss the first qqq qqq hrs and i am an indians fan show the end of what you started then switch but then i ' m a hockey fan what do i know baseball is the all mighty sport .

the answer is they ' re stupid seriously i think you ' re right on the money i ' ve never understood the preoccupation with making sure a rotation has left handed starters the only time it makes sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main rival ( s is loaded with lefthanded hitters other than that i think you ' re completely right .

usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds the mets how about doc ' s performance today have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since qqq and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional phillies reds expos white sox padres etc and the once bright colors have been altered to gray the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookie cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioner ' s office and inter league play on the horizon it ' s nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be .
ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhl ' er his choice of where to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in qqq the one without gretzky because he made an oiler power play which was lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive the oilers missed him more the following year than kurri and i think the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed around the following season and would have beaten pittsburgh with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messier and delayed pittsburgh ' s dynasty by a season .

the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left handed pitching so far no takers personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done if sharpy played just one base every day say third he ' d also improve defensively wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years astacio lasted qqq innings the other day under similar circumstances the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year and piazza has also been great on defense he has thrown out qqq of qqq batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs but i do n ' t think he is as bad as his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs .
have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed in between periods on a tv game that they usually get a goal or an assist can you explain this or is it that they usually talk to stars more than regular players which explains the hight percentage of results after just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they do nt care about this trivial nonsense ttyl tom

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and has n ' t yet been addressed i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base w / o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early when the ball hits the ground when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground enlightenment would be appreciated .

aargh paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of qqq penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in o . t stewart being an ex nordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murder we was robbed it was an excellent game with plenty of end to end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping the nords tied it with over qqq minute to go while lebeau was serving a penalty i do n ' t mind stewart calling a penalty in the last qqq min of the game but at least be fair about it the nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once stewart turned the other cheek bastard patrick roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal he was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night the winning goal should n ' t have gone in do n ' t get me wrong i ' m not blaming the loss on stewart the habs had plenty of chances to capitalize muller leclair haller etc but failed to put the puck in the net that ' s what did them in but mr stewart did n ' t help matters at all oh well at least the bruins lost in o . t also ha ha qqq qqq ooo ( _ ) ooo the czar of mainframe computing qqq mcgill university i ' m too sexy for cobol habs will beat the nords in qqq let ' s go expos hickory dickory doc she took a good look at your cock it ' s really scary all rinkled and hairy it smells like a qqq year old sock - andrew dice clay =
take a look at the standings it ' s real easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place if it ' s working you do n ' t screw it up by changing things just because you think it ought to be different some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to re arrange the batting order until then i think it ' s stupid to focus on what ' s wrong for the simple fact that it ' s working as it is in the majors i do n ' t follow al so i wo n ' t comment on majors in the nl if i had my choice of any qqq in the league for my team it ' d be clark and i ' d hit him third my fantasy team has both grace and murray on it because i ' ve never been able to get clark i ' d take any of the three without hesitation in real life but i think clark is it williams not even close i much prefer his defense but when he is n ' t headcasing it matt has a good solid swing and some real punch if he drops to qqq then he wanders out of cleanup but according to the latest baseball weekly he ' s hitting qqq and in the last week hitting qqq that ' s not exactly chopped liver mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues it ' s rather silly to second guess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first .

attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies the location for this new park was suggested to be near qqq st station at the time the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii but it would be nice to see this a reality it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if that ' s the case the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but that ' s another story i want to see that day !
just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt catch balls off a large bounce take down balls over his head wide etc ad infinitum and he gets the out much of the time some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing you have to give mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag yes i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly )

perhaps it was trottier it happened behind the habs goal if i recall gainey simply did n ' t have his head up as he was picking up the puck if gilmour was taken completely by surprise as gainey was then yeah i would have to say that doug was n ' t playing technically smart hockey in any case to claim as greg did that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous good for you you ' d only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at all certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team and that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go around who would you rather have as your checking centre doug gilmour or doug jarvis for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey you ' re wrong again the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger if gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i do n ' t see why he should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen sively settle down if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle down before you bother following up on my postings you might consider developing your own style after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not your intention cordially as always rm

not bad we had a similar situation slowpitch softball bases loaded weakest hitter at the plate he hits a line drive over the third baseman ' s head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in foul ground almost hitting the fence down that side of the field but the umpire called fair ball i was coaching third yelling at evrybody to move up a base the ump ' s position it was still fair when it passed third base why the other team did n ' t immediately protest i ' ll never know we certainly were n ' t going to argue about it since every body did manage to advance one base safely there was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my runner from second base leg fielded by the ss steps on second to force the runner from first and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway .

threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine do n ' t give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this i ' ll bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play that ' s all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley qqq for his career high point total i ' m surprised that a former goalie would n ' t look closer at his defensive play tommy soderstrom qqq for his team record tying qqq shutouts in only about qqq a season and mark recchi qqq for his all time high team single season scoring mark but here ' s the odd part he could n ' t decide between lindros and recchi for number qqq if he picks recchi as qqq after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros does n ' t that make lindros qqq what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked qqq eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the team ' s record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season qqq tommy soderstrom qqq shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy did n ' t have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also did n ' t play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems there ' s no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number qqq look for him to be traded within qqq years qqq mark recchi again you ca n ' t argue with an all time team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that did n ' t have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mentions rod brind ' amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he was n ' t on the top line this year and did n ' t get as much playing time then again he did n ' t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot he ' ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that he ' ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come garry galley was the team ' s point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just ca n ' t argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him a couple

umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme cases like dust in the pitcher ' s or hitter ' s eyes should an umpire call time the batter has qqq seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch i ' m against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down qqq seconds between pitches and the minute for warm ups but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same goes for pitchers umps should tell them to pitch or feint within qqq seconds or a ball will be called that ' s the way it should be ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine

whoa what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he stores up mistakes that can be used at a later time ths is not so roy is the villain as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first qqq qqq minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders _ make _ some great saves if they did not they would not be in the nhl in the first place i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required however when it comes to a routine shot like sakic ' s especially at such a crucial time in a game i do n ' t think there are any legitimate excuses i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal in a one goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the qqq goal i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty either in fact i think it was a boneheaded move but it led to _ one _ goal only and montreal had a _ two _ goal lead my main concern is the second goal what you say about the skaters is absolutely true but realize that the game was effectively won you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the what if ' s w . r . t missed opportunities they are not important when the final result is decided if i get the time soon i ' ll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive screwups montreal was _ leading _ with a minute to go the goalie is the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification but roy gave up a lousy goal and a team can not afford such a goal who cares of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play i could do a hextall critique if you ' d like but if you ' re going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times for the record i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league in fact i agree that he is i assume you are referring to me however i have pointed out that i think the loss can be blamed on roy i have not said he sucks nor do i think i ' ve made any other derogatory comments if you regard objective and informed fyi observations as derogatory i really ca n ' t help you .

not really though i would n ' t personally say the most deserving candidate wins rarely does a player win roy when called up in mid season and there have been several duds in recent years but this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else i wonder if amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive roty votes he ' s only qqq he could have a long career ahead of him i think they are a second division team they should finish ahead of the royals mariners and possibly athletics but i do n ' t think they ' ll be above qqq i think the east is stronger this year last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible this year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad even if finley returns to form he wo n ' t replace what they lost in abbott sanderson farrell i do n ' t believe it and while their ba may be good and they have decent speed their offense lacks punch they do n ' t have any bona fide power hitters salmon snow davis and curtis none with more than qqq hr potential cheers - valentine

well it looks like just as doug trumped tim beating him to the net with his defensive analyses so tim has gotten in ahead of me the way i was doing it was a little different being me of course i used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth and i calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent average and total performance fielding equivalent runs but i compared not to the average player but the replacement player and here ' s why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system in the al of qqq the average ss is qqq runs above replacement rar cf qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lf qqq rf qqq qqq qqq we may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks substantially right in the equivalent average i have always set league average to qqq i had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of qqq the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is billy ripken i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from qqq as qqq but in the opposite direction as i have set it up that makes for an eqa of qqq yes i can add runs are proportional to eqa squared the difference between qqq squared and qqq squared equals the difference to qqq squared and i rounded off for simplicity an all replacement fielding team would have randy milligan at first qqq willie randolph qqq at second leo gomez qqq at third walt weiss qqq at short kevin bass qqq in left hojo qqq in center and eric anthony qqq in right ugh so the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding rar i can rate them by total rar or rar per some number of batting outs like qqq an average player has a total rar of about qqq qqq batting qqq fielding total rar bat field qqq bonds qqq qqq ventura qqq qqq qqq sandberg qqq qqq thomas qqq qqq qqq van slyke qqq qqq anderson qqq qqq qqq grace qqq qqq raines qqq qqq qqq lankford qqq qqq puckett qqq qqq qqq pendleton qqq qqq alomar qqq qqq qqq finley qqq qqq martinez e qqq qqq qqq bagwell qqq qqq mack qqq qqq qqq butler qqq qqq mcgwire qqq qqq qqq sheffield qqq qqq griffey qqq qqq qqq larkin qqq qqq devereaux qqq qqq qqq grissom qqq qqq henderson qqq qqq qqq walker qqq qqq listach qqq qqq qqq justice qqq qqq lofton qqq qqq qqq w clark qqq qqq baerga qqq qqq qqq kruk qqq qqq qqq d white qqq qqq qqq o smith qqq qqq palmeiro qqq qqq qqq gwynn qqq qqq sierra qqq qqq qqq hollins qqq qqq carter qqq qqq qqq j bell qqq qqq gonzalez qqq qqq notable entries in a qqq batting out rating nl top qqq are bonds qqq lf sandberg qqq qqq van slyke qqq cf grace qqq qqq larkin qqq ss justice qqq rf sheffield qqq qqq one at each position measured mcgriff despite qqq batting rar fifth in league finishes out of the top qqq due to a qqq in fielding last by position galarraga qqq stillwell qqq hansen qqq belliard qqq blauser gad a qqq qqq in league may qqq dascenzo qqq anthony qqq in the al much maligned rickey henderson was worth qqq second only to frank thomas qqq ventura edges edgar at third qqq qqq grebeck rates a potent qqq griffey edges puckett as top cf qqq qqq listach nudges out lofton among rookies qqq qqq and alomar clearly outpoints baerga qqq qqq last by position segui qqq sojo qqq palmer qqq lewis qqq polonia qqq cuyler qqq v hayes qqq all for now .

i remember reading an article in reader ' s digest many moons ago about a similar incident during a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back checking tripped and his skakes flew up in this case the victim ' s mask proved a hinderance since his face was protected and so he did n ' t bother with the usually instinctive reaction to protect his face neck a quick thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using snow to contract the blood vessels from what i can remember .

disclaimer this is for fun in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort using the qqq defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri i ' ve figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders hits stolen have been redefined as plays juan gonzalez would not have made ok i realize that ' s unfair juan ' s probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor but let ' s put it this way if we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with kevin ' s qqq out making ability how many extra hits would go by to try and correlate it to reality a little more i ' ve calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make by the same method i ' ve calculated net extra bases doubles and triples let by finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense onbase plus slug which should represent the player ' s total contribution to the team so do n ' t take it too seriously the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article the short version definition of terms hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented as a rate dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player ' s total contribution national league name hs nhs neb dcon dops nixon o qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq grissom m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq jackson d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lewis d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq dykstra l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq dascenzo d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq finley s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lankford r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq martinez d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq vanslyke a qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sanders r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq butler b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq johnson h qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ordered by dops qqq vanslyke qqq lankford qqq grissom qqq dykstra qqq nixon qqq finley qqq sanders qqq jackson qqq nl average qqq butler qqq martinez qqq dascenzo qqq lewis qqq johnson american league name hs nhs neb dcon dops lofton k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq wilson w qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq white d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq felix j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq devereaux m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq mcrae h qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq yount r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq kelly r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq johnson l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq griffey k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq puckett k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq cuyler m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gonzalez j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq order by dops qqq lofton qqq griffey qqq devereaux qqq white qqq puckett qqq wilson qqq gonzalez qqq yount qqq felix qqq al average qqq kelly qqq johnson qqq mcrae qqq cuyler more discussion dcon formula nhs ndp / pa nhs ndp neb / ab why such a bizzare formula basically it ' s designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are factored into slg that ' s why i used pa and ab as the divisors for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base qqq dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic

are you comparing cullen to salami i would say that that is valid if winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does salami stand around the other team ' s blueline when the puck is in his own end excuse me are the jets playing qqq hockey let me check yes but just barely they have allowed more goals than they have scored sounds an awful lot like salami ' s to me sounds like they would be just as well off or better if he played the solid two way game that our friends in finland claim he is capable of but if he did that he would n ' t be chal lenging for the league lead in goals would he the bi planes might be challenging for first however now let ' s see you have compared timo to anderson and cullen who ' s next mike foligno some of our finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he can play a solid two way game i would have to say that this style of contribution would be more conducive to winning or do n ' t you think so i do n ' t believe it you did compare him to foligno and i honestly had n ' t read this far it would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking your contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you were n ' t trying to be merely argumentative cordially as always rm

how many runs will be scored in denver i do n ' t know but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in mile high stadium during the last few years of the bears zephyrs tenure in the american association here ' s the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games all league games and the ratio i found the same ratios for hr year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on runs scored i ' ll stick with my prediction from last year that it ' ll be one of the top qqq in the nl this year and a fairly large effect on homeruns though apparently not as large as atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park .

i did n ' t say that pitcher ' s fear of throwing strikes to guys like mcgwire bonds and frank thomas was rational i just said that it exists i do n ' t know alex cole ' s batting style at all some questions how tall is he does he go into a crouch like rickey hederson pete rose does he foul off a lot of pitches like brett butler does he take qqq or qqq strikes in each at bat it could be the cole has a good batting eye look above i said that many high obp guys draw their walks because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them not all high obp guys .

and he pitched many not so outstanding ballgames too jack essentially pitched a lot of qqq ball last year this certainly is n ' t irrelevant and iif you replace morris with replacement level quality the blue jays might not win re leadership i do n ' t see it if the leadership effect is there for a starting pitcher you would expect to see its primary effect on the pitching staff you would expect to see the rest of the staff improve instead the rest of the staff declined you can make a reasonable argument for winfield providing leadership the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous year i ' m not saying i buy that but at least that argument makes internal sense greg

while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around gant was n ' t ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately as soon as he stepped out hirschbeck told him to get back in the box now gant does n ' t take a lot of walks between pitches the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call i expect his concentration was n ' t there yet and in a crucial situation i imagine it ' s best to be as calm as possible contributing factors would be gant ' s bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the braves long scoring drought now it ' s pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out etc gant was wrong but hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call gant had n ' t been wasting time all game the game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old the score was qqq qqq with qqq outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position is there any reason hirschbeck could n ' t and should n ' t cut gant a little slack for no discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key situation did he have a date to get to and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic

the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings last night ' s game was hard fought the game in chicago should have been a blow out all in all these two games show a different phillies team in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of qqq run games i do n ' t know how many times i saw them losing by only qqq run if they were able to win most of those they might have been more of a contending team they are qqq qqq so far in extra innings and of course they are qqq qqq .
why not brooks robinson is a defensive liability too and ted williams is a weak hitter even great players decline as they age .
sorry to everyone for wasting space matt the other day you posted that you were doing a mailing list of playoff stats i lost your address please put me on that list thanks .

i believe acker got a ring from his wife when they were married i do n ' t know why you guys keep bickering about morris the stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best this year is another case he just happened to win qqq games i saw many of his games last year he did pitch some good games but this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the qqq qqq innings the clutch innings and the jays would somehow scrape a win for him another major factor in his qqq wins is that cito i do nt realize i have a bullpen gaston would leave morris in for ever therefore giving him many more chances to win games i believe this is the major reason he won qqq games last year barry walker bnr ottawa canada
how did the leafs turn it around i could n ' t get the leaf games on the weekend in ca did the leaf defense wise up overnight did the leafs get in the slot or was it just fluke goals in a goalie duel did the wings turn off the jets or muscle what gives here i caught game qqq on satellite i figured my leafs were washed this is a _ major _ turnaround very few predicted this how how how did it happen wing and leaf perspectives welcomed !
generally i agree with you however qqq last night espn cut away to baseball tonite which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball and they cut away at qqq pacific that ' s quite a contract they have there qqq if espn could n ' t deliver they should have had a transistion plan to let sportschannel pick up the slack nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the us american public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the u . s support your team support your game somebody in r . s . h had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products here ' s an equally excellent idea watch baseball for qqq minutes i know i ' m asking a lot but that ' s what spew bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you wo n ' t consider buying their products because of it .
discussing the fact that there were only qqq players who had ever hit qqq homeruns and stolen qqq bases in their career while hojo was batting anyone have a list not as easy as it sounds to come up with all of them i could n ' t mays mantle aaron henderson morgan bonds dad frank robinson molitor yount guessing now i ' d be interested to see the whole list .

i can understand your anger about the german audience i mean it was the finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the canadien ref called in the last period the germans got a match penalty and a qqq minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd the resulting qqq skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the germans were starting to come up strong i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious but i have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries you should go to the us and watch the way they present the olympics on television or the soccer crowds in england or the finnish spectators at nordic skiing events i mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best team player win and get cheared at i do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team to watch the german soccer team is boring to watch for example but reading the above posting i think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing it is easy to talk of nearly all germans as nazis and nationalists that s the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against germany it is true that there is a great danger of re arising nationalism in germany but from my experience most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now why ca n ' t we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality eg all russians are communists all americans are capitalists all germans are nazis all fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries in my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you do n ' t seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about thomas
i ' m not sure about juha but another top center rauli raitanen [ ss { t is drafted by jets raitanen had very good year and he has played in the finnish nationalteam i believe that he ' ll be one of the best finns in this year ' s wc if matikainen ( head coach elects him to the team .
detroit ' s going to beat toronto in qqq or less granted gilmour should get the hart trophy not lemieux just look at what gilmour did for toronto when you think of toronto who comes to mind gilmour andreychuk potvin ah did i mentio n gilmour back to detroit there really is n ' t a team that could stand up to them if all the players on the team play to their potential no one could stop them yzerman fedorov coffey lindstrom there ' s more firepower there than pittsburgh and they do n ' t tri p over their own skates detroit over toronto in qqq patrick walker detroit over chicago in qqq university of new bruns detroit over vancouver in qqq canada \ __ detroit over nords in qqq disco still sucks "
i thought i ' d post my predicted standings since i find those posted by others to be interesting sorry this is after opening day i certify that these were completed before the first pitch al east qqq new york yankees the most only improved team in this division qqq toronto blue jays stewart and morris no way qqq milwaukee brewers they always seem to do better than i expect qqq baltimore orioles pitching but devareaux anderson and hoiles will drop qqq cleveland indians still do n ' t seem to know what they are doing qqq detroit tigers all key players but fryman are another year past peak qqq boston red sox any team with clemens and viola might be beter than qqq al west this division was the toughest for me to pick whoever of the top qqq gets pitching should win it qqq minnesota twins young pitchers seem to have best chance for success qqq texas rangers i do n ' t know why i have them here jose canseco qqq chicago white sox frank thomas but no pitching qqq oakland a ' s larussa is the best manager and would keep any team close qqq seattle mariners i like pinella but do n ' t see much here qqq kansas city royals will score no runs qqq california angels will win no games nl east qqq montreal expos good all around plus no wallach qqq st louis cardinals jeffries whiten jose clark no galarraga qqq pittsburgh pirates youngsters will take up more slack than expected qqq new york mets some good players still not a team qqq philadelphia phillies they do n ' t impress me qqq florida marlins they know what they ' re doing qqq chicago cubs they do n ' t know what they ' re doing nl west the qqq best teams in baseball are in this division qqq atlanta braves awesome starters but offense could be a concern qqq cincinnati reds would not surprise me if they won it all qqq houston astros any team that signs uribe wo n ' t contend closer to qqq than qqq qqq san diego padres plantier could be the sheffield of qqq qqq los angeles dodgers better pitching than the giants qqq san francisco giants because the rockies just stink qqq colorado rockies will become the seattle mariners of the nl nlcs montreal d atlanta braves fans yes i ' m probably contradicting what i said in my nl west comment alcs new york d minnesota world series new york d montreal hating the yankees will be fashionable again nl mvp barry bonds or maybe mcgriff nl cy young jose rijo al mvp frank thomas will deserve it again but fielder might win it al cy young roger clemens at least will deserve it again -
do n ' t kid around they just might listen .
sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent over qqq games i would amend your definition to underdog a team expected to lose but which wins thanks to underestimated talent .
there are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the jays farm system or the braves his name is bill taylor he was picked up by the jays but had to be offered back to the braves before they were able to send him to the syracuse chiefs .
