no and in fact that was ferreira ' s original strategy which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement there was n ' t exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget the only real question is whether they did it as well as ferreira could have if he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since ferreira has been quoated as saying he ' s going to do something different in anaheim with the ducks my guess is that it was n ' t as good in practice as it was on paper and he ' s tweaking it a bit second time around one also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we had n ' t had those injuries and whether we ' re complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar let ' s also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly kisio which if the rumors i ' ve heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three headed consensus oriented gm imagine for a second where the sharks would be today if that fax machine had n ' t jammed especially an unhappy player that is n ' t playing as well because of it not that i ' d accuse mullen of tanking but his motivation simply was n ' t there and that kind of thing can affect the team exactly at the time they let skriko go we had n ' t yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later i ' d much rather have skriko around than someone like dean kolstad but at that point that was n ' t the choice and since the choice was more one of skriko vs someone like john carter i think the right choice was made for that time period .
why would pollin want to move the caps because i think he owns the cap centre i know they do n ' t sell out all of their games but they draw a lot more than the bullets if you had the situation that abe had would you move if you were guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to park at the stadium because there has been nothing within a half mile until the recent construction in the area can they win a game in ot again rich
has anyone heard what game espn is showing tonight they said they will show whatever game means the most playoff wise i would assume this would be the blues tampa game or the minnesota red wings game anyone heard for sure ?

i dunno about hat i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that ottawa ' s gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger daigle has shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne ' t liked and after coming back from his second multi game suspension for being stupid he ' s really tanked in his performance his stock is dropping like a rock also remember that a lot of teh draft qqq stuff comes from the assumption he ' ll be traded to quebec for lots of prospects it ' s not clear that quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status he ' s still first round but i do n ' t consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point it ' s also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos suspensions no kariya wo n ' t go in the first three for a very simple reason he ' s not leaving college and i do n ' t believe any of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who wo n ' t be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go qqq or qqq unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt my cut on things as they stand today it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him i do n ' t believe they draft him to keep him .

this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division but the giants are going to need every break they can get if they want too hold that lead i do n ' t think they can afford to be lackadaisical and say well it has worked pretty well so far and while we might be able to improve the results we do n ' t think it is worth the risk the two tend to go hand in hand .
of course you can you just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw huh the qqq ' s and qqq ' s were the worst decades for great pitching grove vance dean and not a whole lot else as for the best all around hitters stat wise ruth gehrig foxx greenberg hornsby cobb etc all played before the qqq ' s stat wise the qqq ' s were a graveyard for hitters how do you know which ones do you consider great so sheffield also has better shoes more time between pitches you can run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account well can we compare them or ca n ' t we why we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can keep in mind era to era differences without throwing up our hands in despair you have n ' t shown us what ' s un * reasonable about the mantle sheffield comparison that you yourself did .
the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i have n ' t seen anything in rsb yet gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run he stroked a line drive into the right field corner the ball cleared the three foot high fence and went into the crowd darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball home run now i ' ve seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fan ' s glove was essentially behind darryl ' s several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry what can not be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do n ' t care about winning l . a times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play was the fan wrong should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference or was he human and just reacting by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of qqq rbi through the first nine games i question what he was doing in right center with a left handed pull hitter up and the game on the line had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan the beastmaster

yup then again there are lots of foreign born players on the canadian national soccer team so the brits give something back to you in the end for the record former ny rangers coach ted darth sator recently led lion milan jari kurri ' s former team only the nickname ' s changed devils > lion to their second straight italian championship they made the european final four last autumn after losing to swedish champs malmo in the semis and accomplished this feat using fifteen canadian born players mamma mia marcu $

but they faced the phillies a team that got off to an qqq qqq start to be honest i think the city of houston loves the new owner he has brought baseball back to houston with key acquisitions players that were from the houston area and wanted to play for the astros i do n ' t think that too many people are fearful that mclane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he does n ' t know a whole lot about baseball mclane is a businessman and does n ' t like excuses he makes a valid point that injuries should n ' t be an excuse to this club look at the depth of the bench this season canadele can play qqq positions bass and james are solid outfielders and can hit well too uribe is nice to have as well the pitching staff has qqq legitimate starters we ' re dealing with a young houston team so injuries should n ' t play a big role the only threat is the bullpen if jonesy goes out we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season there is less pressure on the pen .

i could n ' t agree more the jays have a lot of power in their line up so far pitching has been the biggest problem maybe we can get acker back one incident that sticks out in my mind was when derek bell ran back out on to the feild after the jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse bell ran around the field with his arms in the air waving a big towel over his head he looked like a big jerk especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season the next day winfield and carter somehow got the keys to bell ' s jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started the stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for bell ' s jeep bell really freaked out i do n ' t think bell was to popular after that i think that jackson might be trying a little too hard right now he ' s known for being a great outfielder and he ' s not the only blue jay who has been booting balls and playing generally awful andrew

bowman is the genius johnson is n ' t bowman is a great coach johnson a very good one however bowman is really not a modern coach and patrick ' s solution of having him only run the team on game days and delegate most of the day to day responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on patrick ' s part imho bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at this time johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his group of players i would say we have been very lucky here in pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the change with the immense talent on the penguins roster this year a tougher bowman keeps the egos in check johnson on the other hand was able to inspire the younger inexperienced players to new heights both coaches have had different strengths both of which came at exactly the right time another person also mentioned that bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions how can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also keeps the egos in check just a couple of ideas .
i do n ' t personally but clay just posted it yes we do unfortunately it shows that lopez was n ' t as good an example as nieves would have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years which i did n ' t have access to the point remains though knowing a guy ' s minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it the mle is not a projection it ' s an equivalence it ' s a this is how well he hit last year in major league terms rating so in essence he has already reached it i would guess bob clay that essentially half of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons maybe more than half since all of these players are young and improving did they offerman may have been the difference between qqq or qqq place and last place but no more sure they did n ' t have anyone better i suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really in contention if you ' d read what i wrote you ' d be less amazed nowhere do i claim to put any credence in spring training quite the contrary i said that lopez had n ' t done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training could interpret as failure just because i think spring training numbers are meaningless does n ' t mean that bobby cox does it ' s just a case of ruling out one possible explanation for sending lopez down keith mitchell did very very well at aa aaa and the majors over a season then did very very poorly for a year in aaa .
i ' ve been watching playing hockey for a good long time now and i ' ve seen players with questionable tactics but never have i seen what ray did on sunday this guy gets my all time loser award it ' s one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck when they are down it ' s another thing to have a fist fight with someones balls ray should be thrown out of the league what an a * hole .

michael j fox was on letterman about a year ago or two during the playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the bruins while he ' s not exactly a nhler he did mention that the bruins wanted to break ulfie ' s legs or something like that in response to the neely incident it was quite amusing as one of the few letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about anybody know who the pens celebrity hockey player is michael douglas aka michael keaton ?
as will i and the ultimate lurker .
was it just me or did it look like hirschbeck pointed to the qqq umpire before calling that strike i thought that ' s why gant was asking for the appeal to the qqq base umpire he thought hirschbeck had gotten checked swing help from the wrong umpire after hirschbeck called for the pitch but before the pitch was thrown cox came onto the field it was obvious that he was trying to get time called before the pitch but no one was watching your listing pretty much agreed with what i saw with the aforementioned addendums perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark personally i was amazed that gant did n ' t get ejected but that ' s why cox did it ' s called protecting your players and to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game all i can say is that you ' d be making baseball history even in the worst baseball brawls usually only the major instigators are ejected not everyone who comes onto the field and i ' d have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the braves did fri night anyhow that ' s my last two cents on the subject barring outrageous postings i will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving hirschbeck i think there will be some with other teams as well i hope not .

it ' s not a cliche and unlike your comments below it ' s not a tautology it need n ' t have been true if every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality i . e if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker if that ' s your point you should have said so what you in fact said was pitching and defense win championships and later pitching is the essence of baseball neither of which says what you are now claiming was your point and neither of which is true and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches it ' s not clear to me at all that this is true in high scoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time in low scoring games the split is essentially qqq regardless of team ability i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball .
sigh this was written about the game nhlpa hockey qqq which does not have precise up to date rosters why do n ' t people think before they post jeez .
to all the braves doubters do n ' t worry the bats will come alive and the braves will come around the pitching is solid and as long the braves do n ' t have serious injuries to the starting rotation they ' ll continue to pitch well heck with the five starters on the braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five i hope this does n ' t happen though the bats are there pendleton will certainly bat over qqq justice is catching fire bream nixon sanders gant well there ' s too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer right now the cleveland indians have qqq players batting over qqq but i certainly would n ' t their seven for our respective seven though would n ' t the braves be something right now with their pitching and qqq players batting over qqq the bullpen well it is suspect but when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern so anyway i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season i ' m not saying the braves have automatically won the division but i ' m optim istic about their season though it ' s awful painful to watch them at times right now go braves !
this game would have been great as part of a double header on abc or espn the league would have been able to push back to back wins by le magnifique and the great one unfortunately the only network that would have done that was sca seen in few areas and hard to justify as a pay channel gld
i meant to comment on this at the time there ' s just no way baserunning could be that important if it was runs created would n ' t be nearly as accurate as it is runs created is usually about qqq qqq accurate on a team level and there ' s a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the remaining percent .
well when you say without morris you have to mention an assumed replacement if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston soft toss the ball underhand to the opposition every qqq days then of course the blue jays would n ' t have won without morris if the alternative was replacement level then i think it would ' ve been very close and yes morris might ' ve made the difference if the alternative was frank viola the blue jays probably would have won more easily with viola yes you can make the argument that the his presence prevented the team from collapsing in august those innings were probably helpful well i think is complete bs what happened most of the time is that morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him mostly this is because he ' s a lousy qqq inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way that the team can climb out of qqq qqq qqq qqq holes consistently and win them qqq qqq is not to morris credit it ' s to the team ' s credit furthermore while morris did exceed the w l percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he has n ' t done this in previous years in fact his w l record in qqq is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed do you think he just came up with this ability in qqq look at the qqq postseason games he pitched decently in typical morris games morris gets behind team rescues him he ' s not responsible for that rescue and in both those games the team just did n ' t rescue him enough jack morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those qqq games the offense just did n ' t earn him a victory morris is one of those guys who will reture when he ca n ' t start anymore he ' s too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen .

there was an article in one of the toronto papers about this a few months ago probably the globe and mail any ethical journalist even a sports journalist should not accept free meals from a team in any case which was the one of the points the article was making admittdly most sports reporting is mostly with any ethical standards .
as i promised i would give you the name of the panther ' s president after huizenga announced the team name he announced that bill torrey is named the first president of the panthers a little bio from _ sun sentinel _ torrey the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as persident and general manager of the new york islanders throughout his qqq years in the nhl bill torrey ' s bow ties have become as much of a signature as andre agassi ' s hair the panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticket price information in early next month in the meantime huizenga leaves the day to day operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke the vp and gm the florida panthers was chosen as the name of south florida ' s nhl team to focus attention on an endangered species there are qqq to qqq florida panthers in the everglades national park the big cypress national preserve and other parts of southwestern florida the panther is the quickest striking of all cats torrey said hopefully that ' s the way we ' ll play on ice more bio in torrey huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion islanders in qqq and the one most responsible for guiding the islanders to four consecutive stanley cup championships their first after only eight seasons and qqq consecutive winning seasons as executive vice president of the california golden seals torrey watched the seals go to the play offs in qqq only their second nhl season i guess this completes my own personal hat trick said torrey qqq a native of montreal but a resident of bear lakes country club in palm beach jim g other accounts gorycki @ sol . cse . fau . edu jimg @ cybernet . cse . fau . edu i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat adrian belew indicipline "
this just in nolan ryan hurt his right knee in the qqq inning of the rangers orioles game last night he ' ll be having arthoscopic surgery that will at best keep him on the dl for two to five weeks just when i had almost convinced myself that the rangers rotation would stay healthy this year .
he ' s a shortstop by training but he ' s been at second mostly and third this year for the expos .
watch out pitsburgh here come the isles they said we would n ' t make the playoffs and we came in third they said the caps would beat us and they ' re not going to they say that pitsburgh has a qqq ratio of winning the cup but we ' ll prove them wrong l e t s g o i s l a n d e r s bring it back home
well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps st . louis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor det getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go .
i applauded the sabres for making the deal to get fuhr specifically because i thought it would help them win at least one playoff series however i do n ' t think the leafs can be faulted either there is nothing to say that felix wo n ' t be winning playoff series by himself in years to come anyway does anybody else find it ironic that fuhr is up against moog or at least he was until a guy named alex showed up )
and thus we come to one of the true beauties of baseball these things along with many others will never be separated almost everything in baseball is situational and interdependent this is what allows us to carry on all the arguments that we have if everything could be explained and balanced on a statistical basis none of the wonder and mystery would be left why we might have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself > paul feeling a little anti stathead today we will stretch no farm animal beyond its natural length paula @ koufax . cv . hp . com paul andresen hewlett packard qqq qqq
in the boston area you can hear the rangers on wfan and the devils on wabc the whalers on wtic and the red wings on wjr this of course is in addition to the bruins who are currently on weei but may move to whdh because the fools at weei are owned by the celtics and thus will show them over the bruins every time there is a conflict you can also get wbal baltimore but i do n ' t think they have hockey btw i once got a station from indiana that had fort wayne comets games .
i ' m pretty sure that sandberg has done this at least once i know someone will correct me if i ' m wrong rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains the team that scores more runs wins the game flame away john bratt
i have n ' t been following the previous hr ' s but there are two that i saw live that would have to be up there up where there qqq rick monday ' s hr to bury the expos in the nl championship in qqq it was hit off steve rogers who is a rhp and primarily a starter why was he used as a reliever when the spos had reardon and billlee warming up in the bullpen considering monday could n ' t touch lhp lee would have been a safe bet he was n ' t even doing any drugs at that time or so he told me and around qqq others on a recent venture into montreal the blast was n ' t the important aspect it was the timing seventh game a tie game and in the top of the qqq the expos almost came back though qqq mike schmidt hit one that killed the expos in qqq so close yet so far and qqq strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago it went off the technical ring in the big o it almost left the stadium that was hit hard corelmark !
excellent point i hope to god that ted simmons does n ' t get the weird idea of trading for the guy and if he does he had better not include jeff king in the deal oh god what if he traded zane smith and jeff king for vaughn and greg blosser it would be worse than the nichols curse hmm i guess that does n ' t sound sincere enough oh well at least i tried .
here are the ones i can remember offhand kdka qqq am pittsburgh penguins wabc qqq am new jersey devils wbbm qqq am chicago blackhawks wjm qqq am detroit redwings kmox qqq am st louis blues are the flyers on qqq that ' s all i can think of .
does anybody know what is going on with lankford i know he was out for a few games with a slight injury but since he has beenback and before the injury for that matter he has been really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths whereis the ray lankford we saw last year msilverm @ nyx . cs . du . edu go cubs !
that ' s a good way to put it it ' s a quiet confidence i do n ' t feel like i have to defend this team anymore the devils are a puzzle to me they have long been one of the few teams i always dreaded playing their d is n ' t quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough i just ca n ' t figure it out at least last night they mounted an attack bernie nichols was interviewed after game qqq on the late news he was shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso saying that tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him then he got this far away look on his face his voice started trailing off and he said it just is n ' t right it just is n ' t fair and he tried to muster a smile as far as coaching goes a pens islanders match up should be pretty good one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri i ' m sure tom barrasso knows how he feels for so long tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight terreri ' s teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games .

speaking of roger and ilk whatever happened to good ol gln i had him in my kill file since last year ' s playoffs and now that i ' ve moved to a new news reader which does n ' t have kill files i find that he ' s gone i must admit however that unlike gln roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject does n ' t touch on the leafs .
the injury is to his fielding hand which is good unfortunately he may have some ligament damage and may require surgery which would lay him up for a while apparently just a strain of some sort he has n ' t been put on the dl so it ' s probably just day to day .
me too and any yankee stadium gifs as well please thanx in advance ,
it looks like the edmonton oilers just decided to take a european vacation this spring ranford tugnutt benning manson smith buchberger and corson are playing for canada podein and weight are playing for the us is kravchuk playing for the russians i know he had nagging injuries late in the season podein is an interesting case because he was eligible to play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev zubov and andersson obviously sather and pocklington are not the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be certainly in this case they ' ve massively outclassed paramount and the new york rangers .
local to the joe louis arena you mean local to olympia stadium where red wings games were played until fairly recently early qqq comes to mind as far as i know the rest of the post is basically correct if what you meant by local was simply detroit and i ' m being incredibly picky okay sorry about that .
the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules overtime time games that are not shown what the hell kind of shit is this if that would have happened to the flyers ( if they were in the damn playoffs to begin with while i was watching i would have gone throught the roof however everybody is getting pissed off at espn but they are not the ones to blame they have prior contracts that they just ca n ' t simply break whenever they want to the n . h . l is to blame when they signed the deal with espn they had to know of this they had to know shit like this would happen since they would n ' t have complete priority the n . h . l should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn how can the n . h . l do this to its fans how dare they we are the ones that make the damn league exist and they ca n ' t even televise complete playoff games for us to watch they more i write about this the more pissed off i get we must let the n . h . l know that we expect a little better than this if anybody out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know well i had to get that off my chest and while i ' m at it mario is the michael jordan of hockey all that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least qqq last night in the qqq game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off the guy on him was doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall to the ice then the fucking ref ( van helloamend called the guy for holding they replayed the play and my roomate ( who is clueless about hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him it is simple mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic qqq but the thing that really pissed me off is pitt scored the qqq or qqq goal i do n ' t remember on the resulting pp and eventually won qqq qqq his diving calls makes a huge difference in the outcome of a game they got ta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious that is not hockey it allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones this has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat however during the playoffs and qqq periods the damn refs must misplace their balls because they sure do n ' t make any calls that show that they got any all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed .
please count me in also just ca n ' t tell you how excited i was when the islanders beat the rangers in overtime on last friday !

considering how often and how badly he has slammed the pens on coach ' s corner on hockey night in canada it would surprise me as well but then people will do anything for money wo n ' t they ?
no boston probably wo n ' t go down easy but if the sabres had n ' t won game one buffalo would have been out in four and what problem are you having with playoff games here in buffalo there ' s the sabres bruins quebec montreal and whatever espn and abc show and on opposite nights there ' s toronto detroit and whatever espn / abc shows more hockey than a good chunk of north america either side of the border it ' s wonderful and there are thousands of folks who ' d kill to be in your shoes coverage wise .
i would e mail this to you but my mailserver does n ' t recognize you or something anyway the worst pitcher on the yanks if you mean currently on the team then i have to go with scott i ' m a schizophrenic no i ' m not kamienicki sure occasionally the guy can pitch well for qqq or qqq innings but then he starts to go insane a sure sign that he ' s losing his stuff and his mind is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters and yell at himself the worst all time yanks pitcher got ta go with ed new york i have to pitch in gulp new york whitson nuff said - i ' m outta here like vladimir - alan sepinwall xviii
the bowler is john burkett who went to qqq qqq last night he is a bargain pickup on my roto team i got him at a minimum of qqq this is not really true excluding last season the giants has been a better qqq half team in qqq they had a hot august to pull to within a few games of the braves and dodgers before fading in september the giants may go back to earth but not as fast as last season for two reasons qqq barry bonds qqq roger craig is no longer the manager dusty can manage his pitching staffs much better than craig .
i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne clement i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me i ' m hoping this leads to a regular season contract my guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb - april and then the playoffs i envy you canadians with your tsn cbc maybe i ' ll get a dish to pick up canadian tv how much are those things btw ?

boy hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down braves fans i mean all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series also being the cubs fan that i am i really have to hand it to all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have however i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid the way i see it either i ' m just too stupid to acknowledge it or that observation was just plain wrong you might have us confused with bear fans anyway about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs would finish up last in their division even behind florida sheesh these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective division well we ' re ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now i wonder why well the way i see it the east is up for grabs and whoever wants it most is going to take it with the exception of florida every team seems to have good batting and pitching with philly presently leading the pack but i just have to point out if the cubs do take the east they ' ll do it without the benefit of a competent manager however and it pains me to say it the pennant is going to go to the west just had to get that off my chest doc
sh i ' m a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma i ' m hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas sh i ' ve been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the u . s so why is the team moving to a city in texas is it that the owner is a greedy self serving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging sh as much as i ' d like to see the nhl only a qqq hour drive from me i ca n ' t help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly did n ' t support the team sh opinions please i used to work for the stars minnesota supported the team to an extent when i was there we had quite afew sellouts this was the season after the cup run and during the finals norm ' s main bitch was that there was n ' t enough luxury suites and the ones he had were not always full he wanted more boxes and wanted them full he was just asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games at high schools for qqq or college for about qqq that would probably be better mark þ qmpro qqq qqq qqq þ radioactive cats are very very hot !
as i recall the penguins and devils tied for third place last year with identical records as well poor devils they always get screwed yet they should put a scare into pittsburgh they always do pens in qqq .
so done career velarde has n ' t been to columbus if i recall for about three years granted he has n ' t been a full time player but when he does play i ' ve always thought he had a good bat he might be demoralized about not playing full time but he has n ' t been shuttled around i think he ' s been in new york ever since he had qqq hits in qqq ab back in qqq or qqq i believe i do n ' t think he is gold glove calibre but he does n ' t boot it around either i think if velarde is given a chance he could become extremely productive i do n ' t have any stats to back this up and i do n ' t know if his defense would cost any games but i think he could help and he has this year he has qqq hr already same goes for jim leyrtiz he has a big mouth but he does get the job done when he concentrates i think the situation with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super star and he gets pissed about not playing i think he might have realized something when the marlins or rockies did n ' t select him the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now kamieniecki and wickman militello in the bullpen ouch i ' m praying that the bp will return to last year ' s form .

newsgroups rec . sport . baseball harry talks about this incident in his autobiography holy cow unfortunately i can not clarify on this since qqq i read the book a couple of years ago and qqq i do not have my book with me anyway it is a pretty interesting book if you are a harry or cubs fan .
we must have been watching two different games the devil had one hand on mario ' s elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was appropriate using clueless people to substantiate your claims does n ' t give me a lot of confidence in your call either next time consider getting a second opinion from a clueful observer or maybe all those available disagreed .
detailed explanation deleted indeed you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement to rebut my opinion you have made an analogy with a game of chance your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers and hence their ability to win well that ' s certainly true in lotto but it has absolutely nothing to do with the sport of baseball when you start down the wrong path you finish down the wrong path i repeat i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance i do however think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may for some players indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance and i think chris sabo is such a player the beastmaster
have there ever been any other no hitters in mariner history ?
yes but this is irrelevant you ' re talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than qqq feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only qqq foot qqq why is n ' t lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i do n ' t believe there is then would n ' t you rather waste lopez ' s qqq old good season than his qqq old very good season or his qqq old excellent season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use the point was not that qqq ab is a significant sample but rather that he had n ' t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez see above but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players are n ' t that good so they probably wo n ' t be that good this year either and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we ' re being charitable ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who ' s in blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop wanna bet the difference between lopez ' s bat and olson berryhill could be qqq or qqq runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i ' ll take the latter every time just like keith mitchell did that was me and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really do n ' t understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization well argued but inflammatory reply deleted ]
his name is clint malarchuk i ' m not sure what he does now but i ' ve heard he ' s an extra in slasher films .
much text deleted plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective a shining example is if you look at the penguins individual you will find very few minuses that only makes common sense since they did n ' t lose many games until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i . e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team ' s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to really come up with a statistic which really shows a player ' s value let ' s just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like i ' m doing now excuse me )

was going over some videos last night studying qqq and qqq videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting and enlightening here ' s my analysis of jose canseco circa sep qqq and jose canseco circa june qqq qqq he ' s bulked up too much period he needs to lose about qqq pounds not gain more bulk qqq his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively i ' d say he ' s lost qqq of his bat speed and that ' s a huge amount of speed qqq that open stance is killing him note that he acts sort of like brian downing way open to start then closes up as ball is released downing could do this without significant head movement canseco ca n ' t also note that canseco does n ' t always close his stance the same way sometimes his hips are open sometimes they ' re fully closed without a good starting point it ' s hard to make adjustments in your swing what would i do if i were jose aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that i ' d never have to work again i ' d restructure my entire swing first minimize movement before the swing close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely second drop qqq pounds cut out the weight work third relax the wrists will cost some power but until i can find my qqq stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives his strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park if canseco ' s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems he ' ll be out of baseball in three years if not he could still hit qqq hr .
even i noticed that gant ' s demeanor was not one of a batter attempting to regain his concentration gant was stalking off i wonder if gant said something to the ump actually there was a small hand wave by gant as if to say do n ' t bother me gant may have said something here too cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called my impression was that gant was not stepping out he was making a protest about the lack of an appeal to first as has been pointed out earlier there is no appeal to first on a strike i can understand gant feeling a little pressure in a two out risp qqq qqq game ninth inning he let it get to him the ump also overreacted gant was stalking off but i doubt he would have been gone long hirschbeck should have let him have a moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat imho umpires should be more flexible than what hirschbeck showed gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely he would not get a hit a very bad finish to a pretty good game .

i sent a version of this post out a while ago but it was swallowed by the void my apologies if anyone ends up receiving it oh no i was n ' t confused i understood that it was your personal opinion but i thought we were discussing the need to shorten games the arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage them from going to the ballpark i ' d like to see if the increased length of games has negatively affected attendance if it has then there is a problem and something should be done about it if it has n ' t then there is n ' t a problem and there ' s no need to monkey with things as they are .
of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned enough with the cliches my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wo n ' t need much offensive support i realize this is a big if this staff leaves the qqq bosox in the dust there is no legitimate comparison two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs the team that scores the most runs wins this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent the name of the games is to win even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard all i ' m trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense does n ' t need to be as strong .
yeah maybe that is more likely but from the mariners tigers series it seems like every time there are base runners the pitchers seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass the funny thing was that griffey was struggling up until the last game of the four game series if i remember correctly chung yang
have belfour and roenick done another disappearing act at chips are down time when i saw them it looked like the blackhawks defense might carry them along way in the playoffs well they held st louis to qqq shots in game qqq and lost .
this is a general question for us readers how extensive is the playoff coverage down there in canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are wash nyi and chi stl the latter because i ' m in the wrong time zone we in canada are basically swamped with coverage and i wonder how many series games are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into double ot email me so as not to waste bandwidth please my news feed is kind of slow anyways .
i know you all were saying ha the braves score a few runs for maddux that ' ll shut that guy up but no i think we ' ll just keep track a bit longer last outing qqq runs total to date qqq runs qqq games braves record in maddux ' s starts qqq qqq see ya next time dennis

apparently part qqq defensemen numbered qqq through qqq was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if

qqq free agent from minnesota grade i c / d no netter fan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he was n ' t in san jose he was n ' t in kansas city and his name has n ' t appeared on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called up october qqq against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring qqq points in qqq games while playing good defense unfortunately the qqq old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just qqq more points in qqq more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him qqq johan garpenlov season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and qqq round pick in qqq entry draft from vancouver grade a a after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with qqq points in qqq games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club high qqq power play goals contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size qqq qqq qqq lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year qqq david bruce season qqq acquired qqq qqq from st louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner qqq qqq when he led the team in power play goals qqq and was third in total scoring qqq points in qqq games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by qqq games this season of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the qqq old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded qqq mark pederson season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season qqq points in qqq games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive minded snuggerud and he finished with qqq games combined with the flyers and the sharks he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production qqq points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although he ' s not considered a physical forward and good speed he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do qqq john carter season qqq acquired qqq qqq free agent from boston grade i b / b carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just qqq points in qqq games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about qqq games left in the season carter who will turn qqq on may qqq always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties he is very unlikely to be back next season qqq jean francois quintin season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b / b i do n ' t understand why the sharks did n ' t let quintin play any more than the qqq games he played this season he was generally hard working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age qqq ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with qqq points in those qqq games while not being a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the qqq qqq season limited quintin the team ' s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just qqq games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season qqq mark beaufait season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq supplemental draft grade i after a all star season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing qqq games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size qqq qqq qqq lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it ' s too early to judge him based on qqq nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city qqq jaroslav otevrel season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea qqq games midway through the season he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those qqq games he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready qqq michel picard season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b / c the qqq old picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in qqq games scoring qqq goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft qqq dody wood season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i d / d although perhaps i should n ' t give a grade at all i have been accused of knocking on wood too much then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although qqq games is a small example he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering qqq penalty minutes in those qqq games projecting to to qqq in an qqq season he ' s not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else his relatively small size qqq qqq qqq lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer .
the hawks won the norris div and sealed their fate it ' s bad luck to win the norris the hawks will sweep the blues in their dreams but will lose in qqq in reality i predict that in the qqq game with the blues belfour will go down on his knees qqq time s and will spend the rest of the time looking behind him self butcher will pound roenick and the warthawks have no one tough enough to prevent it
i plan on being in the toronto area sometime this summer late june or early july and would like to attend a blue jay game i would appreciate if anyone could give me information on how to obtain tickets for blue jay games i would prefer to get good seats and i assume this would require going through some ticket broker and paying ticket broker info for the toronto area and / or ticket info directly through the blue jays would be appreciated i ' ll bring oxygen if need be my schedule is flexible so any games are candidates though i ' d prefer to see texas thanks in advance .

i ' m a little worried about this pitching thing qqq is scarry even for the first qqq games of the season mesa sp seems to be settling down he pitched well against the red soxs but the rocket matched him i got a chance to watch them play against california wednesday and he pitched well also then the dam broke wickander came in and promptly it was qqq qqq qqq run homer by snow i heard the guys on espn say that qqq of the tribe ' s top qqq prospects are pitchers anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they are the tribe is on espn again tonight against oakland .
well i could become a fan seriously this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost everywhere that i ' ve sampled in fact the playoffs almost do n ' t exist now ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york one ' s midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near orgasm over keenan ' s hiring summarizing keenan is a winner and will give the broadway bums da business in pursuing the next cup chase this will be an interesting combination to watch keenan has been paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his advice on any player moves will be listened to closely a lot of big player moves will happen remember that keenan got rid of denis savard the country club days are over if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered keenan the big money to put up and shut up back in january the rangers might not be heading for golf now one of keenan ' s first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier will be the team ' s captain by then smith might have some bargains on keenan ' s advice like maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi gld

wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team boston which sweeney you ask well of course bob sweeney the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of they still have qqq sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing game winner in ot in game qqq and another big goal seconds after fuhr made qqq point blank saves this is why grant has qqq rings to put buffalo ahead in the qqq yes neely countered a minute later but had n ' t this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i think boston would have notched their first win of the series well the sabres have n ' t made it to the end of this series yet but i certainly feel they ' ve got boston right were they want them actually they ' ve got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about one more astronomical game by fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and i think borque neely jouneau sp and company are gon na be swinging a new stick weather is perfect for golf season real soon i ' m not gon na waiger anything on this because i ' ve seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey talking about golf was that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one the whole ot all qqq minute of it was a tesiment to buffalo ' s ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end something they were n ' t necessarily in the regular season the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds i do n ' t normally like penalties being called in such ultra critical points but this was blatent finally the sabres won a faceoff they were n ' t that hot in this dept the rest of the game when lafontaine scooped at the puck qqq times when hawerchuck took his shot quite a boomer but blue stopped this one he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up i did n ' t realize it went in until the announcer started screaming they score they score the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on .

that ' s not inner calm it ' s boredom and it ' s being spoiled the arena ' s been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted it ' s been seemingly forever since the team lost and we ' ve forgotten what it ' s like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory while i ' m glad to have the pens doing so well in some ways it was a better high back when the pens beat the bruins two years ago and the rangers last year too much of a good thing is not always good for you .
the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec defender who deflected the puck the re play officials did not take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first non goal so it seemed pretty non controversial i agree that it was a great game good to see roy and damphousse back into form hopefully the sign of good things to come .
why do you suppose he ' s immune to the ravages of time he ' s qqq in a few years he ' ll be qqq he does n ' t get to as many grounders as he used to and will get to fewer still as his legs go as they do on every human so far remember willie mays was a defensive liability at he end of his career too ditto mickey mantle ditto just about everyone else who played into their late qqq ' s .
i suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning an outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls preventing both singles and doubles and also cut off more uncatchable balls turinging doubles into singles however a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles has anyone seen these players positioning do butler and felix play deep and lankford martinez and wilson shallow or is this a park effect i thought butler liked to play shallow .

in four of the five games finns have played the goalie has been chosen the best player of the opposing team in the fifth the finnish goalie ketterer was elected the best finn has this to do with the goalies having good days in these games or are the finnish players just lousy scorers anyway quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally the exception of course being canada vs italy it looks like the goalies are getting too good is this due to their equipment getting bigger so they cover more their gloves e . g seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way mikko wihervaara

hmmm what about walks and sb baerga got clobbered by alomar in obp and beat him in slg by a lesser margin even putting aside any other factors a player with a qqq point edge in obp is more productive than a player with a qqq point edge in slg the issue has been studied before and i doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way people see the batting average and the hr but they do n ' t really know their value is worth unless they ' ve studied the issue closely the fact is that baerga ate up a lot more outs than alomar while baerga was making outs alomar was drawing walks and being on base for carter winfield et . al .

so all us hockey automobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand espn delays the martinsville race by a day for the nfl draft espn shows baseball instead of the overtime of a nhl playoff game gimme a break guys does anyone know why this race is tape delay especially until monday is this the weekend for the nfl draft if so postponing the race for a day is a real slap in the face for racing fans i ' m afraid you ' re right as usual as i recall they ' ve been doing this ever since they started covering the draft live i wish they could work out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as tnn to get the race on live but i guess espn is n ' t much into sharing it also clarifies where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we did n ' t already know -

last night boston red sox win its qqq games of qqq games by beating seattle qqq qqq roger clemson pitch not so dominate he walked at least qqq man in first qqq inns but valetin and greenwell hit homeruns and red sox prevail clemens struggled with his control but was also the beneficiary of some pretty shoddy umpiring but to be fair most of the walks were early in the game and he adjusted he was also helped by dare i say it some pretty good defense by the sox including rivera playing at second not his normal position actually clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win considering the sox almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the qqq on mo ' s error catching a throw over i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle considering darwin will faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight must win in april they ' ve already won qqq more games so far than anyone thought they would at this point of the season i hope people are n ' t getting too caught up in this streak it ' s been fun but teams have qqq qqq streaks all the time and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get so much attention .

you ca n ' t but good luck trying .
useless which of and a but ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way range is not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman the ability to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the dirt stretching for others and so forth is important thus putouts do provide some information maybe what we need is a comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the first baseman vs how many he actually got .
actually there can be any number of players on a side you can have a qqq roster a qqq roster etc ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine

hi i was just wondering if anyone knew when erickson and keith miller are expected to come back and what exactly ails them sincerely ,
since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx qqq posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame qqq back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson was still recovering from his late season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson and berryhill could n ' t hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and do n ' t walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he would n ' t have gotten his job back qqq there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you ' d have to eat that salary which is n ' t huge but is n ' t tiddleywinks either i think olson ' s at about qqq berryhill at qqq but that ' s only what i recall qqq yes i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to play in this also what is it that qqq of the qqq players are n ' t eligible for arbitration only the qqq that were on the roster the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the first time olson berryhill go on the dl qqq i am still disappointed that lopez is n ' t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i ' d rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we wo n ' t need him as for the schuerholz cox conversation i imagine it went like this remember they ' ve both been gm ' s the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired cox ok we ' ve sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be schuerholz well we ' ll have to send nieves down too deion just wo n ' t sign that baseball only contract we ca n ' t count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman ' s not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher ' s gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give us some pitching depth in qqq cox yep that ' ll be nice too bad deion wo n ' t sign ok i ' ll look for nieves when justice starts having berry berry er back problems again now what about klesko schuerholz well we ' ve still got to fork out another qqq mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he does n ' t seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he gets rid of brian jordan then i ' d have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i ' ll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at bats for cabrera while we wait try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that does n ' t work then perhaps sid ' s knees could be persuaded to act up there ' s always the qqq dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he ' s not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts in richmond he ' ll start walking more besides if he ' s going to be arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let ' s see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i got ta keep lopez sure i did n ' t think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has got ta go you know that he ' ll get qqq million in arbitration may as well put it off that one extra year besides until olson ' s shown his stuff a little bit i ca n ' t trade him besides berryhill ' s a left handed hitter you know how rare that is cox do n ' t you mean a left handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you ' re the one who would n ' t write lopez into the lineup cox well you ' re the one who went out and got me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez would n ' t be used to our pitching staff ' s stuff he got some time with them this spring looked pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win qqq games the pennant the world series i ' ll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto

i agree it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game my roommate just about sh * t when they threw the octopus on the ice thanks for explaining the significance of that btw the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report other then that hats off to espn now if they ' ll only make a habit of this yeah right baseball seasons started zzzzzz koz
looks like bob errey ' s ring really sparkles in that locker room and everyone else wants one too correct me if i ' m wrong though just through the net not through e mail i do n ' t need qqq rl ' s in my e mail but was n ' t boston down qqq qqq vs buffalo last year ? boston lost qqq and qqq at home and won qqq and qqq in buffalo whoever wins game qqq will advance simple as that )

no hal mcrae is the worst manager in baseball i ' ve never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can one of the best raw talent staffs in the league and he ' s still finding a way to lose i ' ll be surprised if he makes it through the next qqq weeks unless drastic improvement is made .
no kidding just ask the white sox too bad really - john neuharth
the hart trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think in terms of who was the best player rather in terms of who was the most valuable to the team and valuable to his team was not and should not be considered synonymous with best we are talking about a time when honour and attitude not measurable skills were the most important assets a player brought to his team his league and his sport this was before the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory the hart trophy is not a prize it is an honour -
no in what still imho ranks as the all time greatest pr blunder not to mention on ice blunder the whalers ever committed gm eddie johnston and coach rick ley decided that francis was incapable as a leader and stripped him of the captain ' s c in december of qqq the whole organization read ej and ley and by default owner richard gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind sided by ej dumped on francis all season starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract publicly humiliating him stripping him of the c and then trading him that spring to the penguins classy guy that ej the loss of francis and too a lesser extent ulf was one of a series of decimating player moves by ej which stripped the personality and fan awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today gratuitous good ej note he did preside over the organization when it acquired verbeek cassels sanderson poulin nylander etc he stripped the roster but he did lay a foundation ]

it was a classy move but it looks like espn is going to devote most of the coverage to the pens on tuesday night they continued to broadcast the pen devil game even though pittsburgh had the game well in control granted they did show some bonus coverage of the caps and isles but they cut away from the close game which went into double ot to update us on the fifth goal of the rout thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils imho they should program some variety into the telecasts ( yes i know the game shown on saturday is between the b ' s and sabres probably throwing a bone to us bruin fans and what about the cambell conference i ' d like to see a game in the norris or smythe why not have back to back nights of national hockey night just a thought .
you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl even rexi in his prime was more of a good regular in new york edmonton than a superstar in his own right although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf i think that the ny management made a mistake and remember how edmonton called reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup why did they call him yeah we ' ve had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past i almost knifed my brother in anger when sweden scored two in the final minute of the wc semifinals back in qqq or what about the three goals antero kivela let in with five minutes to go against the russkies in lake qqq ugh o . k that was bad luck if penguins have the same kind of luck this year in the playoffs they ' ll never win the cup they are still the best team .
i was wondering if any star trek tng fans in this newsgroup knew of a possible relationship between the bruins players douris moog and the klingon names duras and worf son of moog i suppose it ' s a coincidence just curious ,
but only in ny nj philadelphia and chicago everywhere else the only reason sportschannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts and local baseball pre empted the nhl playoffs thus far into this playoff season espn abc has given me more hockey in qqq days qqq game than sportschannel did qqq games if people want hockey on tv they should watch hockey on tv i bet the ratings for hockey on sunday on abc went into the toilet next week there will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey someone in this thread said that he would n ' t watch the games even if they were on tv and this is a r . s . h regular contributor xenophobes north of border need n ' t fear the us americanization of our game because us americans will never figure out how to market hockey here support your team support your game .

i do n ' t think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing to pay the price i ' m sure someone out there in net land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold but even if the trends are relatively flat you have to consider what is happening on a team by team basis when the tv money dries up franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources one of the best sources may be ticket sales example qqq the dodgers the dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales and probably believe that they have the ability to raise prices without hindering revenues i certainly think that is true example qqq the padres they will be lucky to average qqq fans a game this year if they raise prices less if they want to increase their overall revenue base the best thing they can do is put a winning team on the field but given that wo n ' t happen it wo n ' t they can probably make more money by lowering ticket prices and running frequent promotions will they do that i have no idea but they wo n ' t increase prices because it wo n ' t work for them the only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place each team ' s market is somewhat different and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces as a buiness manager i would never want to lower my prices but sometimes that strategy is necessary and sometimes it works you have to consider everything if you want continued success the beastmaster

wiggins alan but that ' s besides the point i ' m sure people would feel slightly sympathetic for rickey if he were killed but they would also be criticizing him a lot more for his actions example how about jose canseco he gets a couple of speeding tickets and all of the sudden his attitude is awful what the hell do speeding tickets have to do with clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters talk about it all the time or brian hunter and keith mitchell both of whom had dwi problems towards the end of last year two years ago it was cited as a sign of their immaturity etc meanwhile dykstra almost killed both himself and daulton and i did n ' t read any sportswriter complaining about that they may have talked about how bad it was for the phillies but i never read anywhere criticism of dykstra ' s character or daulton ' s intelligence for that matter based on this incident .

i disagree mcnall has demonstrated with gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well very few fans real istically expect the kings to do well this year although i do and yet they still go out to see gretzky this is the marketing strategy selling the game by selling the stars that is employed by baseball and notably the nba and this is the attitude that the new bettman mcnall leadership is bringing to the league they have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars timo salami and brett hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know are n ' t worth a damn and yet being benificiaries of marketing oriented coaching strategies have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer the very fans the nhl wants to attract that these players are indeed superstars it ai n ' t nearly so simple as this the casual fan does n ' t think about much at all can you actually find an adult with a qqq digit iq who believes that mcdonalds makes good hamburgers yes but apparently the rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi bilities has he he was hyped initially as a superstar but outside of one grey cup game he has done very little to maintain enhance that assess ment of his talents most argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him cordially as always rm
stuff deleted as i recall the author of the _ original _ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons roger on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a jingoistic rant but you also supported the name changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent fwiw i do not think the flaming was warranted nor do i think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all just an observation however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so it ' s a pointless exercise anyway if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not central to the original article something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so _ without _ an organized professional league to play in in this case honouring builders of the _ league _ as opposed to builders of the _ sport _ becomes a chicken and egg type question although it was the chicken dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it does n ' t look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up .

qqq qqq los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose ' s decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i ' m not stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose ' s choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made qqq saves in sundays qqq qqq opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no qqq man behind rick knickle stauber had a qqq qqq qqq record and qqq goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no qqq job from hrudey knickle he won qqq of qqq decisions but had a bloated qqq average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and has n ' t played since march qqq yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey ' s backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i ' m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too qqq what happened to no qqq stauber wondered not that i ' d be happy with no qqq but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the qqq old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a qqq qqq loss to san jose on dec qqq an qqq qqq loss to the new york rangers on jan qqq a qqq qqq tie with detroit on feb qqq an qqq qqq loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he did n ' t do it melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he is n ' t satisfied to be a backup i ' m not blaming robb for the losses but if you ' re going to be no qqq you ' ve got to be able to walk your talk you ' ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season qqq qqq qqq struggled when the team hit a mid season slump did n ' t play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in qqq only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i ' ve been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i would n ' t be here anybody who would disagree with that does n ' t know me i ' m not saying barry does n ' t know me but do n ' t say i ' ve been without expectations if anything i ' m a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i did n ' t play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it ' s a bit of a jump he said you ' re almost no qqq or if you play a good game you ' re no qqq and if you do n ' t you ' re no qqq why does jack nicklaus shoot a qqq and then a qqq can you explain that that ' s what barry wanted me to explain to him why i did n ' t come through when he counted on me i do n ' t know what i do know is it ' s a sport i ' ll be there melrose ' s goalie of the future statement does n ' t mean much to stauber before you know it i ' ll be qqq and there will be no future he said game qqq of the kings flames playoff series drew a qqq nielsen rating on abc channel qqq here in la the kings averaged a qqq nielsen rating in the qqq regular season games aired on channel qqq around the nhl san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a qqq qqq qqq mark in their qqq nhl season kingston was qqq qqq qqq over the past qqq years with the sharks former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager last nights games win qqq van qqq van leads qqq qqq tor qqq det qqq det leads qqq qqq stan willis willis @ empire . dnet . hac . com net contact l . a kings

just some thoughts i do n ' t usually like to post simply to make fun of a player but this time i could n ' t resist during the pens devils game last night second period i think kevin stevens was in the penalty box nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself all kjell could do at qqq and qqq pounds was laugh and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen ulf is getting a little out of hand lately his cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent as everybody in the meadowlands except for the officials could see last night he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the devil ' s throat i ' ve always supported the argument he does his job by being irritating but he ' s starting to push it over the edge imho of course holik ' s chop to barrasso ' s neck was n ' t too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night and last night as well although the qqq seconds he danced around the devils end was pretty exciting .

what are the leafs to do i am a leaf supporter and i say the leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits pat burns if you were pat burns what would you do living in the bay area i do not get enough leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag i would appreciate comments on the leaf detroit qqq line match ups but here is the basic idea andreychuck and borchevsky have no business playing against the wings they are too small the key to any leafs success will have to be clark he is the only centre who can have any presence within qqq lengths of the slot where the hell is anderson anderson can in days past get under peoples skin put a little more bluntly anderson has to be an asshole he used to be good at it we need him now perhaps perhaps the leafs can shut down detroit ' s second line i was dissappointed to see shepard and yserbeart flying last night these guys are the swing players for the wings last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the wings this has to happen again clark anderson gilmour should be able to out hustle this line anderson should do a nasty on yserbeart clark should bang the hell out of sheppard score gilmour score suggestions clarke anderson gilmour vs sheppard yserbeart andreychuck borchevsy vs detroit checking line toronto ' s checking line vs yzerman fedorov probert pray lots as suggested i would bench andreychuck and borchevsky to stir things up and through a monkey wrench into detroits game plan however if the detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their checking line against these finesse players well then let them play potvin can not be faulted on qqq of the goals keep him in van hellamond can not be faulted for the leafs demise either the wings defense shut down the leafs especially in the slot i hope pat burns realizes that his team was out hit out skated and out coached on monday night this was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating this calls for drastic measures or tee off is next monday - jake .

my god hope we do n ' t have to put up with this kind of junk all season how many home runs by tartabull just qqq right you must be thinking of dean palmer or juan gonzalez both of texas who each had qqq homers i do n ' t know how many to follow but he was qqq for qqq .
i ' m totally p - o ' d too vancouver winnipeg is great west coast hockey fast paced and loads of talent what i ' ve seen so far is hardly entertaining with the exception of the odd shift every now then of course i missed calgary la pitts jersey amen that ' s cheaper than what i do phone calls there must be a better system one ring adams to linden he scores two rings bure rushes up the ice he scores etc etc )
in case anyone missed it i ' m reposting this and i ' m also selling some other stuff i ' ve sold one but i still have qqq left for sale i also realize that qqq is alot of money especially if you do n ' t normally collect cards so if enough people are interested i ' ll break up the set into team sets i ' m not sure how much for each it would be nice to just sell them for qqq each but then the people who get the whalers and devils note i ' m not bagging on these teams its just that they do n ' t have alot of good rookie cards in this set would be subsidizing the people who want chicago or pittsburgh so i ' ll have to make it varialble pricing but most of them should be about qqq or qqq dollars ok someone asked for this one but he ' s from canada if he can get me the be the alternate also i would like to sell qqq upperdeck pavel bure rookie cards note these are not in the ud low ' s set mentioned above qqq each they are qqq in the book but the qqq goes for postage packaging and insurance and if there is something you want that you do n ' t see e mail me i may have it or may be able to get it for you .

i wholeheartedly endorse it i have no problem with the have n ' t been to many a ' s games have you seriously i do n ' t mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played however i do n ' t like qqq qqq games that take qqq hours because there ' s a lot of dead time going on in that game i do n ' t find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason whitey herzog used to be the master of this the game could be way out of reach and he ' d still be making switches for platoon advantage i want to see the game not people standing around i do n ' t really enjoy watching nfl football games in person for example because there ' s so much dead time you do n ' t really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television because they ' re busy showing you replays i do n ' t like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game the ncaa has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year they ' re going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year and they ' re going to a qqq second clock there ' s also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i ' m watching them on the tube and if i ' m going there in person for me going to an a ' s game has become a major commitment of time one that i ' m not willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a ' s revenue from me .
not only have i not heard of the western business school or the university of western ontario i ' ve never even wondered if there was a western ontario and judging by the quality of the posts coming from there i ' m still not sure that the place exists perhaps i should be impressed though since it appears that grade school children in that area have access to the internet .
but why would you want to use rbi rbi is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting if you believe in clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp if you want to see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing but why use them when so many better stats are out there ?
bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style player he plays hard at all times does n ' t disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject i am pretty sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis when you add to that jagr ' s better rating i think it becomes evident that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one .
i love it how all of these people are blaming the phillies success on a weak division why do n ' t we look at the record of the teams in each division read inter divisional play we ' ll see that the east is really kicking the shit out of the west i know it is early but that is all we have to go on atlanta is just so strong with their qqq ba cincinnati is qqq qqq coming off a sweep at veteran ' s stadium in philadelphia and houston was swept in it ' s first three games by the phillies in the astrodome that my western division friends shows that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you think phils all the way in qqq braves hit like a aaa club reds need marge
the garbage started hitting the field well before the sunday game it started on thursday or friday i ca n ' t recall which games i did n ' t watch on tbs deion was getting pelted with trash the whole time it seemed the announcers talked about the change in the seating in the bleachers and how that made it easier for the events that transpired i actually thought at the start of the sunday slugfest that since it was a sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different more refined surprise ?
hi there i was wondering if anyone knew if john wetteland was put on the dl again after his first qqq period was up i read in the usa today sports section that he is on for surgery to repair broken toe and was wondering if that was new i thought he was just letting it heal another question is derek lilliquist the main closer for the indians now that olin is gone i need to know cause i need to find a reliever to replace wetteland and so far lilliquist is doing ok any information on either of the players would be greatly appreciated thank you for your time ryan robin _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
so far simmons looks like a total idiot qqq zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all qqq i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week now otto ' s latest debacle has restored simmon ' s reputation now he looks like he is back in his qqq form when he had the al ' s highest era among starters four our sake ( not ted ' s sake i hope he pitches with a qqq era for the rest of the season yeah right qqq tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing they are still doing decently but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters merced had a very good oba his rookie year he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year qqq walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract qqq leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i ca n ' t understand his and management ' s fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do what ' s the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs ( slaught should have played in all qqq games he has a good average against right handed pitching did n ' t leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere was n ' t very fit last year qqq dennis moeller is scary qqq candeleria well he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season maybe it will be in qqq qqq range but qqq million plus come on other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks patterson has served the pirates very well each year so far he seems to have pitched well for the rangers i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead qqq the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance has n ' t been too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that qqq rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke qqq slaught how come he was n ' t given a contract extension last year now his value has increased immensely qqq lonnie smith well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount let ' s see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better now why did nt the pirates go after eric davis an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year he wo n ' t be an asset he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field qqq management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay qqq alex cole fiasco the pirates infield and cf positions look good the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders eric davis van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and merced ( i think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting simmons did have options for the outfield ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmon ' s tenure was getting alex cole really cheap too bad qqq compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it the pirates can rant and rave they will not get those picks as of now the issue is still being appealed now if this does nt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will on a final note tim wakefield wo n ' t be as awful as he was in his last qqq starts but do n ' t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season also if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss redus ' s clutch hitting and his speed ( he has peaked in the second half of the last qqq seasons >
dunno about miller if you mean scott erickson currently the reigning twins least consistent good player he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that made it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily and is expected back on the mound sunday .
devallano went earlier and more extensively to the russian strategy than anyone else and was the first gm to waste high draft choices on young russians devallano would still be gm but he succombed to demers pleading to make the oates federko et al trade which is the deal that sealed his fate murray has made some decent trades no doubt but these are more due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on his part washington was too cheap to pay ciccarelli so they essentially gave him away and carson was really a big anchor to the team and he was able to sucker a rookie gm to give him paul coffey for deadweight if detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short then he will have wasted an opportunity because manson was available and he was unable to pull the trigger it is his judgement that he has enough with what he ' s got yzerman does n ' t have that many more years in his prime .

i like the clark williams bonds order pitchers can only walk clark with qqq outs unlike last year williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the on deck circle since matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the giants a lot when bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal qqq and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton if you bat bonds before the other sluggers then you do n ' t want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the bases infront of bonds and i think that ' s a problem the giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot .
i agree and disagree john is saying that the batters efforts will result in qqq more wins then losses while you are probably correct that qqq does not mean qqq more wins then losses it means something i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by qqq in each of qqq pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by qqq in each of qqq pas thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between john ' s statistic and winning games thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus i ' m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to qqq in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitchers bad performances giving up qqq runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that pulled an qqq qqq night would give large negatives no but really only because you have a smaller sample size i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win the offence has many more outs to do something about but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either if i am down qqq runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be qqq before the possesion in which the free throws were made look if you are down qqq point with qqq seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it really does not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down i ' ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by qqq on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by qqq i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs k ' s bb ' s etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man who was more valuble to their team probably john who was the better pitcher they were probably about the same .

here is a review of some of the off ice things that have affected the ahl this year st john ' s maple leafs problems the st john ' s maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems on ice the leafs won the atlantic division title but off ice was less happy a strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn since mid jan they have played home games in places like montreal cornwall and charlottetown their playoff home games will be played in the metro center in halifax ns one demostration got violent workers attacked a leafs bus and rocked it and broke windows in the st john ' s memorial stadium despite the problems toronto officials insist that the leafs will return to st john ' s once the strike ends senators sold the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to the ottawa senators nhl organization they are the only canadian nhl team with an american ahl affiliate and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic provinces this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl head office but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in may the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership rather than maintaining the qqq history of the ahl in new haven the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown new brunswick and are expected to move there dallas helps hawks stay in moncton after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of moncton the winnipeg jets changed their mind the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from qqq to around a dozen and they wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise enter the dallas lone stars dallas agreed to supply the remaining qqq or qqq players to the moncton franchise thus keeping the hawks in the new brunswick city the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over qqq the hawks only sold qqq for this year saint john flames official the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of saint john nb the saint john blue flames will play in the qqq exhibition center the flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble caps follow jacks to maine despite rumors to the contrary the capitals will follow the baltimore skipjacks to maine the caps current farm team the baltimore skipjacks announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with portland they would supply a dozen or so players including qqq goalies they become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders ahl game of the week in early january the ahl started a game of the week the game produced by i believe pyman productions was televised across the canadian maritimes and northeastern us the first few weeks saw two games of the week one in canada and another in the us but since then there has been only one sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and i believe atlantic sports network in canada but i ' m not sure about that i am not sure if playoff games will be covered utica gone syracuse added there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next season there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them what the ahl might look like next year one option another option northern division southern division adirondack red wings adirondack springfield indians springfield providence bruins providence cd islanders cdi portland pirates hershey binghamton southern division rochester hershey bears hamilton binghamton rangers utica rochester americans hamilton canucks atlantic division utica devils portland st john ' s atlantic division saint john st john ' s maple leafs moncton moncton hawks halifax halifax citadels fredericton cape breton oilers cape breton fredericton canadiens charlottetown saint john blue flames charlottetown senators move is unofficial as yet )
stuff deleted i think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post namely quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a gm in st louis this trade was an absolutely stupid trade for st louis and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made we can give quinn credit for being an opportunist here stuff about other trades deleted how do you figure both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year they both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down qqq qqq in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in qqq games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less talent specifically if i remember correctly third place teams how does this make vancouver more improved further if i ' m not mistaken the wings had more points than vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many .
what done .
his performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the cincy series it may also be him pressing a little as for the baserunning it does not appear to be just lankford dent made the bad call sending lankford in the sunday night game against cincy but everyone had a bad time against the dodger ' s catcher good question at least it does n ' t appear that we are seeing the same zeile )
i thought that walt weiss was jewish i seem to recall this was mentioned once while he was still at oakland also i have my suspicions about esther canseco nee haddad .
probably because everyone that is everyone who has cable can watch every braves game they are the only team that has all of its games broadcast nationwide and if you do n ' t like your local team or you do n ' t have a local team the braves can kind of become your local team because you can watch them every day - i ' m outta here like vladimir - alan
finland d jyrki lumme qqq d teppo numminen qqq d peter ahola qqq well well they do n ' t like our defenders mainly lumme and numminen c jari kurri qqq c christian ruuttu qqq now do you think that ruuttu is only worth qqq i think it might be qqq r teemu selanne qqq compared to kurri selanne ' s points are too high lets make it qqq or qqq well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie qqq qqq or the players listed above and luck there ' s presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n ' t be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a qqq team in the nhl wow now it looks like you do n ' t like our players what about guys like nieminen jutila riihijarvi varvio laukkanen makela keskinen and even if he is aging ruotsalainen the main difference between finnish and north american players is that our players tend to be better in the larger rink the canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in europe and i think that there was more in our success than ketterer and luck though they helped i think that the main reason was that the team worked well together .
teemu selanne had qqq goals keith tkachuk had one and luciano borsato scored a rare jets shorthanded goal as the jets held on to beat the canucks qqq qqq and close the series to qqq qqq trevor linden and pavel bure had two goals each for the canucks in a losing cause selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump scoring two powerplay goals and one on a nice breakaway pass from darrin shannon hard work paid off tonight for the jets and if the jets continue to exhibit this strong work effort they can make a series of it i woofed last year when we were up qqq qqq i ai n ' t going to do that again i ' ll have to be quietly happy with a solid performance )

detroit april qqq in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the detroit redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a qqq qqq win over the best team in the nhl the toronto maple leafs the leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior detroit squad and clearly deserved to win only the biased officiating of andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior visiting side prevented an all out massacre of the wings by the league ' s best team alan
buffalo fans some people in the discussion group as well as commentator al on espn believe that game qqq is critical for the sabres helloooo the sabres are ahead qqq games to qqq not behind as a life long sabres fan i am well aware of their ability to choke but let ' s not exaggerate that as long as the sabres win one of the next qqq games be it game qqq or game qqq they are still in good shape ahead qqq games to qqq with game qqq to be played at buffalo if they lose games three and four then start worrying game qqq is critical for boston not buffalo .
how long can the leafs play short handed and still be expected to score they did some fine penely killing in the first qqq men down for a couple of minutes at one point but they just could n ' t keep it up they spent virtually the entire game either short handed or just coming off a penelty as soon as they ' d get re grouped they ' re penalized again sheesh like gilmour said after the qqq you ca n ' t go calling every little push an shove in a game like that and if you ' re going to you have to do it for both teams pearson one of my four favorite leafs played like a bonehead i saw him personally screw up at least qqq good scoring opportunities and then he got that bonehead qqq major high sticking penalty cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand full of games ago and he played a good game if the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay clark ' s got to get tough he ' s got to intimidate and go for the net send clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board and pearson heck maybe he should be benched i hate to repeat grapes but where the heck was foligno zezel ca n ' t do all the checking himself and get macllwain on the move we need some speed out there keep potvin in net he did okay considering although like i said a couple weeks ago potvin messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year he can easily do it again my prediction last week was toronto in qqq that the games det wins will be blow outs and the game tor wins will be close i still stand by that do n ' t fret leafs fans in order to win in qqq the other team has to win qqq burns is going to make some magic he ' ll mix up some lines match the wings line per line he ' ll have his team checking hard and he ' ll never let them get out numbered in their own end the leafs will win wednesday night and will take qqq or their home games probably the first one .
yes yes i can see it now all those sabre fans finally taking their sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them after qqq years of playoff frustration and being up qqq games to nil i guess it is a pretty good bet but there has not been a team that has come back from an qqq qqq deficit since qqq could this be the year do n ' t throw out the moth balls yet )
i have lived in the boston area for qqq years now they have been talking about a new boston garden hockey basketball since i ' ve lived here one day the last hurdle has been overcome and the next day there ' s a new hurdle fans have been grumbling about foxboro stadium or whatever it ' s called this year for nearly as long but there are only preliminary proposals for a new stadium local politics prevents anything from being done in a timely fashion there will not be a new ballpark in my lifetime .
finally an objective source alomar ' s a great player but so is baerga nice to see the objective source cited rather than my dad ' s bigger than your dad posts .
no one says you have to read any of it ralph go play in traffic or take a nap they work for me .
i ' m confused how is it hal mcrae ' s fault that he ca n ' t win with a team whose best offensive player is phil hiatt i mean let ' s be real kansas city will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end up near qqq they have less offense than any other team in baseball even if you count the expansion teams .
actually steve i think he was refering to the leafs and when they can be expected to hit the greens .
frank mich even show at least your parents did n ' t move you idaho the only things that get any coverage there are football basketball and baseball !
ah but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time but it happens when there ' s less than qqq minutes to go quite often this sense creates drama even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer ' s attention in baseball only qqq players are involved in the action for about here comes a wild guess qqq of the time and they ' re just playing a sophisticated game of catch hold the ball step out of the box adjust chains touch self in interesting locations there ' s a lot of dead time with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes qqq qqq pitches or helen dell playing the organ dodger fans will appreciate that one to the non baseball junkie this is boring at any rate i ' m not putting baseball down for this i ' ve been an avid fan since i can remember it ' s just that watching a baseball game on t . v at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie that ' s what major league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game it ' s because of t . v not because football has more action than baseball .
ah so you finally found a use for that super slo mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing sorority babes in heat congrats trust me you ' d have a helluva time manipulating them besides if you converted the film to video you ' d have all kinds of artifacts because of the difference in frame rate unless you ' re an expert at doing qqq pulldown for a laserdisc company or something hey no fair what about fettucine alfredo griffin the guy practically has to pivot the bat around along with his body daulton does n ' t strike me as all that strange he ' s a little bit quiet at the plate but like franco gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane the first time i watched julio franco i did n ' t think anyone could hit like that now i marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes contact it ' s solid he ' s got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch i wonder if phil plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while on the throne sure looks like it how ' bout one to add to your list travis fryman the guy plants his front foot and seems to swing across his body he generates a lot of power but i keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips well they ' re already spoken for by several people but i ' d add robbie alomar ' s name to the list among others i really like dean palmer ' s swing for some twisted reason as well as pedro munoz ' s swing a thought about may it looks like they ' ve taught him to turn on the ball imho he ' s going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he ' s going to see lots of sinkers sliders low and away unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left and left center imho you ' re going to see a good number of weak grounders to the right side of the infield in the next month .
note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners when if cablevision vp chuck dolan ' s purchase of the islanders goes through the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold their original owners were and they ' ve remained due to a lucrative tv contract the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the prism pay channel there are six teams affiliated with regional sc ' s another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets and other locals like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements with all this cross ownership i was surprised that espn got the deal this season gld
what did happen to the swiss team last year they reached the semi final and now after qqq matches no points and even no goals after the qqq against italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun qqq by the russian team now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the b level does anybody know if this wc is the qualification tournement for the olympic games qqq in lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them .
according to what reasonable principle of justice does standing in intimate geographical and psychological relations to a league give one some privileged right to play in it ?
i do n ' t know if you could call him rushed but big ben mcdonald did n ' t much time at all in the minors of course that was because the balls used in aaa had seams too large and gave mcdonald blisters forcing him to go on the dl several times he ' s done most of his learning here in the majors of course gregg wild thing olson and mike deserved a cy young mussina did n ' t spend much time in the minors either i read somewhere that pitchers are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that has something to do with it let ' s go o ' s why not admiral steve still reliving sept qqq qqq liu _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ~
was n ' t hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball while running bases i heard something about him recieving stiches and a possible broken nose is he at the park let ' s see how they feel when he ' s qqq and qqq with a qqq era i have my doubts about fernando well when a fan favorite gets dumped he ' s gon na get an outstanding ovation on his first return let ' s add up the ovations cal has recieved over the years during the game and compare that to billy btw sutcliffe ' s getting knocked around pretty good rangers up qqq qqq in the bottom of the fourth .

this is what kills me speaking of die hard that ' s what i did when i read this died hard laughing toronto to the cup finals first of all has anyone on the planet heard of the team from detroit al morgani or however you spell the idiot ' s name must be from chicago because on espn he said it ' s not even close chicago will definatly win the norris division in the playoffs no other team is close everyone is picking chicago i do n ' t get it he says it ' s an easy choice god chicago was qqq qqq qqq against the wings and they won the division by a point or two followed closely by toronto who is also a good team as for the leafs beating detroit doubt it but even if they do they are n ' t going to get by chicago if even more amazingly they get past the hawks they would probably face vancouver and lose as for the habs reaching the finals forget it even i as a devoted wings fan will watch the penguins easily three peat as cup winners lemieux jagr tocchet stevens and barrasso its a done deal sorry detroit wait til next year but hey these were paul ' s picks and everyone has a right to their own opinnions but the leafs to the finals yeah if they make it there i ' ll walk to toronto to get some tickets and that ' s a qqq mile walk - ryan -

the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save ?
some deletions well we agree on the last part one of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player ' s performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year a player ' s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year a player ' s ability to walk or infielder ' s defensive average are correlated better that is to say given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they ' ll do next year put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better one of the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero adding to the sample size does n ' t seem to help much as a counterexample to what you showed consider the following two players from qqq qqq non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lemon qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq if you had had these two players in qqq by your logic in those clutch situations you ' d bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye well in qqq maldonado hit qqq in non clutch and qqq in clutch while lemon hit qqq in non clutch and qqq in clutch before you accuse me of completely cooking the data there were qqq players who had qqq clutch at bats every year from qqq qqq according to elias as a simple measure of clutchness let ' s just look at clutch ba non clutch ba if you use qqq to predict qqq for those qqq players you ' d find that qqq of the qqq were below league average in that measure both in qqq qqq and in qqq qqq were above league average in both periods and the other qqq were above in one and below in the other if you were just flipping coins you ' d expect to get qqq above below in both and qqq that switched the difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant btw correlating players _ overall _ batting average from qqq with qqq gives a correlation coefficient of qqq which is significant at something better than the qqq confidence level correlating their clutch non clutch ba for the same period gives a correlation of qqq significant at no level of any interest actually it ' s technically incorrect to say that we ca n ' t predict future clutch performance it ' s more correct to say that we ca n ' t predict future clutch performance with any skill harold
that brings up an interesting point anyone else catch espn ' s piece about prospects and the relationship between age career length mvps and hall of fame members it was part of their preseason special basically they looked at players that had amassed qqq plate appearances or abs by the time they were qqq and noticed some interesting things for starters they found out such players comprised the majority of mvps in the history of the game they also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame the kicker though was that they actually did some number crunching and found that such players careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group they also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals hrs etc of the other players the first group outhit the second something like qqq to qqq in raw ba and blew away the second group in such categories as hrs qqq rbis etc it was the most impressive thing i ' ve seen on espn in recent memory i guess ray knight makes his rebuttal tonight .
how about matt nokes qqq run single against ron darling was that a hit or what while watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding the boss talking about mark connor as bullpen coach he said something like it ' s mark connor ' s fault that the bullpen is so horrible here we go again george sticking his non baseball nose in the baseball business shut up george just spend the money get the players and leave buck and the coaches and players alone .
so if the braves run production falls to qqq per game which is certainly where it ' s headed if they ' re lucky does that mean they ' ll finish first ?
while atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation i feel that their relief staff may be suspect they do n ' t have a real closer although mike stanton qqq saves has been used in that role did n ' t stanton start off great last year and then falter despite this your point is well taken atlanta does n ' t seem to have the same personality as a ny team thus is unlikely to self destruct for houston to take ' em atlanta needs to suffer some injuries particularly to their starting rotation from what i understand boever and murphy were considered expendable by the club houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players art doug jones is the key to houston ' s success he must have another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west lousey spring right a strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling bullpen the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so far biggio and finley just are n ' t doing their job of getting on base instead of filling his role as an rbi man bagwell has had to assume biggio and finley ' s job biggio concerns me since he usually starts the season very strong on a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year ' s uniform there is talk that their road uniform will be blech traditional grey with the word houston written across the chest if i ' m not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange shiver mclane ' s favorite color is red so i ' m really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound horrible i ' d like to see the uniform of the qqq return they may not have been pretty but houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and i liked it astros fan since the days of ryan scott smith cruz davis bass hatcher .
the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as vancouver outscored winnipeg qqq qqq the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight with the canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period only to stave off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent the jets looked more dangerous in this one but it did n ' t make a difference in the numbers that counted goals vancouver ' s big line produced again with centre cliff ronning and left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the canucks to a qqq qqq lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of bautin and ulanov mental lapses by the defence and goal scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals however as in the first game the jets worked hard to take the game to the canucks in the second period the jets dominated the second checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early the hard work paid off late in the second when tie domi caught vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score qqq qqq domi ' s goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush to the canuck ' s collapsing defence the canucks were unwilling to do anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds the jets were allowed to set up and make plays both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck zone the canucks on the other hand looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third the jet ' s tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mclean ' s legs and into the net to tie the game at qqq qqq the canuck ' s discordant play picked up where it left off this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight winnipeg defence that were never supported however as in the first and second canuck goals a jet defensive lapse re bonehead play stalled the winnipeg comeback with the faceoff in the winnipeg zone pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with no jet defender anywhere near him bure who had been invisible in the game up to that point took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance by then it was too late for the jets to come back essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack canucks qqq winnipeg qqq next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games qqq -
i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauch ' s ineptitude in managing the pitching staff down the stretch he abused jim bunning chris short and robin roberts i think those are the three pitching each on only qqq days rest for quite some time by the time they hit the last qqq weeks of the season obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm oh well roberts was long gone he was probably an oriole in qqq or maybe a colt qqq the qqq starter was art mahaffey the previous year ' s ace dennis bennett was the qqq starter they were indeed qqq up with qqq to go but they won their final two games after the horrid qqq streak the final game victory bunning ' s qqq win if memory serves kept the reds from tying for the title they and the phils were both qqq game behind the cards with the giants another game back the mets could n ' t hold an early lead against the cards that final sunday or there would have been a qqq tie too bad they could n ' t have saved some of the qqq or so runs they scored on saturday when they crushed st louis -

hi all you ryno fans and those interested todays chicago tribune had this written in it today in regards to ryne sandberg ryne sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken left hand and could be back in the lineup by may qqq manager jim lefebvre said friday doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his gloved hand i ' m not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up said lefebvre he ' s a fast healer and he does n ' t like being on the disabled list he ' s been running since he was hurt march qqq and is in the best shape of his life may qqq is his target date for getting back in the lineup hold on to your hats cub fans more later as information presents itself .

i believe that phil esposito was the first to wear qqq when he played with the rangers in the qqq this was the season that they put the rangers crest and modern style numbers on the jerseys instead of the new york or rangers block letters and two colour numbers he took qqq because the rangers already had a qqq hockey night in canada made a big thing out of it saying it was the biggest uniform style change in a long time this was before pittsburgh and vancouver changed their colours dwarf

the first time i heard this piece of news was on the post game radio interview here in jyvaskyla that was the bronze medal game in the sm liiga which tichonov ' s team porin assat the aces of town pori lost vasili the son of victor tichonov the famous soviet coach said that for a long time the sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post but he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes he definitely wo n ' t be coaching assat anymore after three seasons i do n ' t know why vasili is a good coach i believe assat was a good team produced many players to our national team assat was n ' t a skilled team imho but they had the fighting spirit after all they butchered jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to tps the champs but assat was n ' t consistent only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the sm liiga i am not qqq sure about the deal with the sharks as i said he wants to be the head coach but he and the sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the wc i doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe they ' ll do some compromise .

eric roush writes funny i did n ' t realize mr tanner brought up bob knepper v pam postema in the first place thought it was someone named jacobs why if a statement is truly idiotic and is universally thought so the challenge is a waste of panting further challenges that have nothing yes nothing to do with baseball are wasting others time you got a problem with what bob knepper thinks let ' s hear it in some sort of categorical manner actually i question whether either knepper or postema are n ' t old news at this point although what i have read of postema ' s book is interesting i agree this far sez you that does not come out in what you say down the road here yo even elementary school children have had access to our postings albeit in an edited form you want them to hear you talk like this do n ' t you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same or do you want them to think you ' re some politically correct demagogue who ' s oh so sensitive ho hum plus you ' re here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that i do n ' t read what bs you got a problem with what jacobs says what knepper thinks all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas more and better speech yours is the easy way out as for knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them you know that often the best copy for the news is the one that is n ' t pre prepared they know knepper has controversial ideas about women they pop some question about postema an interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same game off the top of my head i guess no if my guess is right knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him and postema gets a book for it and he does n ' t now why did n ' t i think of that rg

my favorite was the barry foote homer that bounced on waveland and through a second floor window across the street second though would be the kong drive that was last seen bouncing down the street that dead ends to the park at waveland .
why do you say this as of now the pens and bruins have played the same number of games and given up the same number of goals they are tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league behind chicago first and toronto second the pens weak spot is defense only by comparison to their offense which is second in the league to detroit but the pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the bruins are that is they are both very strong .
we can not isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wo n ' t claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference is too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the differences are too great there in your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player since they are now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most cases morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components as i do albeit imperfectly is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you do )
so what ' s the deal with bill wirtz apparently the blackhawks st louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual but the hawks reported the attendace as qqq gee i wonder if wirtz is planning to use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv what a schmuck in other tv news the penguins announced yesterday that they will have qqq fewer broadcast tv games and will have qqq games on some sort of subscription pay per view system yuck .

yeah they finally came to agreement on a contract as soon as the ink was dry he suddenly decided kansas city was a neat place to be ergo the want to play for the national team was a bargaining chip .
yet i ' m not bored either most people i know say that winning the second cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one but i ' m every bit as excited this year and i am experiencing that inner calm to which susan originally referred inner calm is not boredom as far as the arena in general being boring well richard ' s got that right it ' s been that way all season i attribute it to a lot of new fans who just do n ' t have the same spirit and knowledge as long time fans at last tuesday ' s game i overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time i ' m confident in the pens but i ' m also not stupid enough to think for one minute that it ' s impossible for new jersey to blow them out of this series i doubt that will happen but it ' s possible bored uh uh spoiled not in the least forgot what excitement is like living through that amazing streak was n ' t exciting i do n ' t take a darned thing for granted god look at chicago and i see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway it is n ' t gon na last forever and i intend to enjoy it while i can .
someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one of the games even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly allowing qqq or qqq runs .
i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in conference names and using geographical references in the divisional names although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the game imo it ' s a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners _ hope _ will have an effect and it does n ' t say much for the mentality of anybody it works on either surprise i agree totally the points system is fine if everybody at all times has played the same number of games since this is almost never the case winning percentage is the way to go i do n ' t particularly care if it is an american thing either if it works .

i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week while the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the oiler ' s future rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium northlands has offered to buy the oilers for qqq million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington .

yah so he certainly did n ' t earn his last one how many games did he blow in the world series all of the ones he started oh yes definitely therefore morris is better than clemens do n ' t give me that shit if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall give credit where credit is due this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick i ' m willing to bet they do n ' t finish sixth i ' m also willing to bet they do n ' t finish first and if you give me qqq qqq odds i ' m willing to bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays .

speaking of paddock what ' s he doing slagging sandlak if sandlak puts his mind to it he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a real mistake is n ' t sandbag out with an injury now anyways perhaps paddock meant to say that momesso was the cheap short artist after all that would make more sense .
in this morning ' s paper or was it on the radio vizquel was quoted as saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still easily thrown out riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the final play more memorable seems a litle cocky to me but he made it work so he ' s entitled doug dudgeon dept of chemical engineering qqq dudgeon @ opus . cheme . washington . edu university of washington seattle
at the time i did n ' t really want the sox to sign either i was more than a little worried about viola ' s elbow but you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of rumors that morris was coming to the red sox they ended up with viola instead now i ' m even happier viola seems to have rebounded nicely how long did viola sign for three years i generally agree with their policy of avoiding long term contracts for pitchers but i think they enforce it rather too strictly these days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals which leaves the jays with morris and stewart if the jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers they will have to accept greater risks any idea what the option year deal is for morris are there any automatic activation clauses what is the buyout amount ? f

the problem with your nihilistic approach roger is that it takes all the sense out of the game by your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded there ' s no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons after all any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but did n ' t roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead or are you willing to consider empirical evidence teams go to the post season when they win more games than anybody else in their division if they do n ' t make the post season they do n ' t win the series will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring collecting if so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games in your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that can not be analyzed while many of us are thinking things like base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like it ' s a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid season had winfield been dhing for toronto was babe ruth a good player he played on some ws winning teams but did he have anything to do with their success it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder were n ' t it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook it is necessary to score more runs than one ' s opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one ' s opponent from scoring runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you to make some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp + slg than gene larkin this year the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given qqq qqq guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy so how about real life person a robs a service station with two people in it using a qqq automatic pistol gets qqq and is convicted and sentenced for three years person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a qqq revolver gets qqq and is convicted since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this they do n ' t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence is meaningless or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk ?
there is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling under to players demands a manager much like a military officer needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during a game after the game it ' s no big deal but when there is no time to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart see boston red sox ff strawberry ' s demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like demands i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i ' m used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from strawberry russ porter quoted strawberry as saying i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best in that role paraphrased by my memory and bias that seems like a fairly non petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is doing if he thinks that batting me third will help the team then i am all for it we ' d ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl ' s response as petulant personally i think his argument is nonsense and that it really does n ' t matter much in which order the qqq qqq players in the order are batted except for personal stats if i were darryl i ' d probably answer that question the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get paid for rbis i think it is best for me to bat fourth but i am willing to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team or something like that it would be helpful at salary time my rbis were down because i was hitting third and make him sound like a team player since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content free .
yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are finally moving in the right direction they should finish over qqq this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august however i would take back a few moves qqq the jim abbott trade i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young this year but he wo n ' t because the right side of the yanks infield is n ' t good enough so why was this not a good trade jt snow how many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the angels i know it ' s early but if you ' ve seen this kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player the yanks should have kept him what about mattingly you ask well it ' s great that the yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal but he ' s qqq years older than snow and just does n ' t have the same bat speed as before his back injury it ' s a shame but as a yankee fan who wants to see the best yankee team i ' d take snow over mattingly at first the yanks also gave up two promising propects with snow for abbott besides with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling hitchcock they are just loaded with propects i know abbotts only qqq but this was too much to give up i believe george forced this trade because he believes and he ' s right that abbott will be a big hit in ny however i ' d like to see the yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show qqq wade boggs i live in boston and like wade a lot but his career is winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop a long term solution i . e hensley muelins russ davis velarde besides wade just does n ' t have any range what a shame about charlie hayes huh qqq spike owen see wade boggs i ' d much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the yankee staff era qqq point and these guys are on the down sides of their careers qqq danny tartabull yes he ' s put up some tremendous numbers and it ' s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year but he never is we should expect qqq games max out of him meanwhile gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o ' neil is playing left field i believe o ' neil led nl outfielders in assists last year and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder what i ' m basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year they should at the gm level be planning for a qqq or qqq world series this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they will be ready in a year or two i ' m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal was all george it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now the veterans are always available and can be added at any time like boston did this year develop the young players first then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep them let ' s all us yankee fans hope that george does n ' t dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect i ' m really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for example george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away have patience george and we will all enjoy the future fire bucky and trade the kids and it ' s baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time !

i believe we are down to two the qqq and the qqq i do n ' t remember a qqq but rather a qqq anyways it ' s gone now the period length is a minimum not a maximum you can keep a guy on the qqq for as long as you want if he ' s still certified as injured the player must be periodically re evaluated to determine if he ' s still injured thus you can not park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers if you get someone qualified for the qqq that reduces the frequency of re evaluations there is no longer i believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl when there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists - king sparky banaian " no taxes no new taxes kbanaian @ pitzer . claremont . edu | no old taxes we are taxed dept of economics pitzer college | enough rep alan keyes latest qqq gdp forecast qqq please run alan )
darryl strawberry ' s moon shots were fun he can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out he ' d be rounding second base by the time they landed we used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at laguardia for some of them then _ bull_durham _ came out and that was changed on homers he pulled that did n ' t go high they were microwave home runs microwave as in they got outta there in a hurry in a game in qqq he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that did n ' t even allow bob murphy the luxury of a home run call the story went he stayed in the clubhouse the with the mets down by two and two on davey johnson sent for him to pinch hit he came out of the clubhouse saying one swing and we go home he hit the homer ran the bases then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home those were the days .
stuff deleted ok here ' s the solution to your problem move to canada yesterday i was able to watch four games the nj pitt at qqq on abc la cal at qqq cbc buff bos at qqq tsn and fox and mon que at qqq cbc i think that if each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for qqq odd consecutive nights i have n ' t counted so that ' s a pure guess i have two tv ' s in my house and i set them up side by side to watch mon que and keep an eye on bos buff at the same time i did the same for the two afternoon games btw those abc commentaters were great i was quite impressed they seemed to know that their audience was n ' t likely to be well schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job they were quite impartial also imo .
sure they might if an error is recorded on for example a ground ball ie the batter would otherwise be out it is officially a hitless at bat if it ' s some other type of error greenwell lets a single go by it does n ' t effect the obp but most errors are counted .
hey folks saw the giants play ball at the stick saturday april qqq it was the game where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two out two run homer to right to win it it was n ' t the game where the fans threw the give away fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer too bad huh well the stick is still cold the saturday game ended at qqq and it was cold then i ca n ' t imagine night games in april at the stick the wind kicked up a little too and i got this idea at most games there ' s a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time i propose a kid ' s clean up corps composed mainly of qqq qqq year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the toro smooths the infield and grab the trash it might not be glamorous but at that age i probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers everybody wins here whaddaya think ?

espn is pathetic i have been watching everybody complain about espn ' s coverage and i agree with all of you might i suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing we all knew that espn ' s coverage was going to suck i mean have you ever watched during the regular season sportscenter coverage of hockey it sucks i mean really sucks espn does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass i was really pissed of about last night coverage i go to school in ohio i know the indians suck so why show them if i were bill clement i would shoot myself anyway after i calmed down after i realized that they were not going to show overtime of the caps isles game i thought to myself i knew that this was going to happen in fact i remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring devils game overall i think espn does not care if they show hockey or not and i firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans ie because of contract obligations screw you espn praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit go hawks !
