lori the regular penguins poster here on rec . sport . hockey indicated to me via e mail that on the nights that pirates baseball and penguins playoff games coincide the pens will be covered on wdve fm qqq .
do n ' t worry this is a perfectly normal state of affairs had they actually been using him you should be worried he ' s recovered totally from his injury that ' s why he ' s not pitching so he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again pitching on qqq days rest and then have fun dining in the diamond club in shea stadium while ay struggles every day out there i ' ve be quite happy to drop john franco just the same bring back randy myers no better make that bring back neil allen !
two years ago mark messier appeared on david letterman the summer he signed wit h the rangers i remember he and mike gartner taking slapshots at the camera one finally was a bullseye and the screen went blank it was funny if you saw it i guess .
gaetz wo n ' t be back there ' s been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired but i have n ' t seen confirmation it was clear from my talks with the sharks doctors that he was n ' t going to make it for a while and the sharks would have to sign him to a contract which given his problems competing at the ihl level this spring does n ' t make sense .
judging by the way the reds pitchers have performed thus far it appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape qqq )

funny you should mention it this is exactly the case i was going to make i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans even if the team sucks but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking one pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them if they suddenly dropped to say qqq points you ' d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon ok my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it but my point is that it was n ' t mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come i . e a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps in and says i ' m nit picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started it might help to think about what would go through a fan ' s mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pens was it gee mario lemieux is amazing i ' ll go watch him play or was it gee now we ' ve got a kick ass guy on our side i ' ll go watch him play i think it was the latter i do n ' t think this is accurate the tickets sell but people do n ' t go to the games i think this thread has already been discussed season ticket holders in la do n ' t always use their tickets so in effect after the kings initial success following gretzky ' s arrival qqq to qqq points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable i claim that since gretzky ' s arrival they have at the very least been competitive i also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynasty but that ' s another story and included only because i do n ' t like mcnall anyway mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc but as i said when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold for the short term imo although i think that it ' s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them better well at least we are in full agreement here so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point could n ' t resist yes but they are doing no worse than last year i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games it ' s difficult to predict but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without selanne .
again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion thanks for speaking for all those who did n ' t feel it was important enough to say something themselves i would n ' t say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to it represents a subset that you do n ' t belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this is n ' t a moderated group look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint three that come to mind are as follows qqq say it subtly result it may not be clear qqq say it directly yet politely result probably it will spark some interesting conversation qqq say it directly and obnoxiously result validity goes right out the window you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against you .
um what eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time winfield as produced consistently for almsot qqq years and excellently on several occasions dave kingman ' s best year was like darryl strawberry ' s typical year with the mets darrell evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which is all that kong did whom are you talking about yes eddie murray is marginal but that ' s because he ' s qqq years old he was n ' t marginal for a long time not smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better than anyone else ever has yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you had n ' t noticed one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder like whom there are many players in the hall who are n ' t anywhere near as goos as the guys you ' re running down that ' s already the case by some standards but the bad players in the hall are all from the qqq ' s and qqq ' s recent picks have generally been excellent no but who cares was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth not really but he obviously belongs there the hall has generally had about the top qqq of major leaguers as more players come through the game more will be in that top qqq and yes it ' s pretty easy to argue that smith yount evans winfield etc are in the top qqq dave kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his career of course garvey has n ' t gotten a lot of hof press so i do n ' t know what you mean as for ryan is his w l better than morris that ' s what a lot of voters tend to look at and morris was awfully good for a decade and does n ' t lead mlb history in walks allowed either .
once on jeopardy the category was jewish sports heros believe it or not the answer was this pitcher had four no hitters with the dodgers in the qqq the contestant said who is hank aaron alex trebek said something like i do n ' t think hank aaron was a pitcher "
be fair he did walk qqq batters in qqq ip he also allowed only three hits none for extra bases only one run a pretty good outing all told there is no such thing as a must win game this early in the season and we can always hope that darwin pitches well !
c ' mon tommy soderstrom is having a fine rookie i think he ' s a rookie season with the flyers i ' m sure most of you knew that already but just in case .
that ' s because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that and was day to day only available as a pinchrunner .
if team yeah but soderstrom ' s mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the average helmet and cage variety it has a certain appeal on its own josh

i really do n ' t want to get into a didso didnot debate with you but this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement i did not say nor did i imply that i could predict the future you have inferred that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting sabo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq samuel qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel the above data is for a qqq period ending last season last season samuel batted qqq while sabo hit qqq not park adjusted this season they are both hitting below qqq albeit sabo with more at bats i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than sabo i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager or even a reds fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo ah properly yes i see please help me what exactly is everything else that pointed to sabo i must say i was not aware of the publication can you email me the information regarding its availability and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive study on say supply side economics i did n ' t mean to insult you but i never did believe you were on the right path i ' m sorry for my contrary opinion position i also regret that i do n ' t have the ability to prove that you are wrong but you are it is what it says it is the second is your statement not mine well actually i have n ' t yet but i ' m not finished looking that is i have n ' t yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years qqq qqq and then reversed that relationship in qqq nope sorry but if you were interested in a reason why i expect chris sabo ' s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could if you were interested in a reason why i expect joe carter ' s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could but you ' re not interested in that because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population and they ca n ' t be the problem here is that i do believe you i accept your work i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless no better than a coin toss i actually do accept your work as it happens i also have an opinion that in certain situations for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance for that player and chris sabo is one such player well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you the beastmaster
while we ' re on the multipurpose subject let ' s not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets jets it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because it ' s circular the seats are almost always too far from the action the mets announcers kiner murphy in particular have always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is .

so that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo griffin just because it worked a team winning does n ' t mean that everything that it ' s doing is right a team not winning does n ' t mean that everything that it ' s doing is wrong or otherwise to borrow the sharks situation you would say that george kingston should be fired by then it ' s too late the problem with not fixing something while it ' s working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix so the blue jays were simply perfect last year there was nothing that they could have done to have improved that team not .
not always true in fact in the case of doug gilmour he actually praises them europeans that do those things are scum in cherry ' s opinion canadian kids that do them are tough just like a real canadian ulf samuelsson cheap shots mark messier ' s ribs and don wants ulf ' s head doug gilmour breaks tomas sandstrom ' s arm and don says sandstrom had it coming methinks don is either very confused or just a bigot most likely the latter i used to like don cherry i thought he was great but i ' m starting to see his true colors redneck and the more i see of them the more i think he ' s just an asshole .
quoting cire y trehguad to all and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other team captain trivia would be appreciated cyt cyt was n ' t ron francis captain of the whalers when he was traded to cyt pittsburgh cyt and rick tochett was the captain of the flyers when traded to the pens cyt recently cyt caleb cyt and let us not forget that the new jersey devils traded cyt captain kirk muller for stephen richer and chorske cyt man i hated that trade well as for team captains being traded in there first year in the nhl the edmonton oilers traded their captain ron chiperfield to the quebec nordique right at the trading deadline for goaltender ron lowe in their second year of existence the edmonton oilers again right at the trade deadline traded their captain this time b . j mcdonald to the vancouver canucks along with the rights to winger ken berry for garry lariviere and the rights to lars gunner petterson as for more captain trivia the next edmonton captain was lee fogilin who was later traded to the buffalo sabres after him was wayne gretzky who was traded to l a then came kevin low who only this year was traded to the n y rangers so that every captain the edmonton oilers have had has been traded the present captain is craig mctavish and we ' ll just have to wait and see well talk to you later steve
amusing is n ' t it seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win consider the red sox game last night the sox won qqq qqq in the bottom of the qqq who won the game - clemens pitched a strong nine innings allowing only two runs - ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so - quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the go ahead run and got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of the inning looks like a team effort to me yet only quantrill got credit for the win how about the offense - dawson and vaughn hit i think hrs early in the game without either one the sox would have lost in nine - quintana led off the qqq with a solid single - zupcic pinch ran for quintana providing the speed to go from first to third when - cooper ripped a second single in the inning - melvin avoided the dp getting the run home with a sac fly not much of a help but it was something - scrub richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy cooper all the way from first hill ' s lack of defense helped cooper and zupcic were credited with runs melvin and richardson were credited with rbis but it seems to me that it was quintana ' s hit that set up the whole inning and did melvin really contribute as much as richardson furthermore people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than runs did melvin contribute more than cooper cooper provided the game winning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous you can argue that obp and slg do n ' t show you who came through in the clutch but r & rbi do n ' t do any better at least obp and slg do n ' t claim to try to tell you that here ' s to the red sox who contributed to last night ' s victory all qqq of them !
hi there i ' m german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for pitchers what does it say era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game thus if a pitcher pitched qqq innings and gave up qqq earned run his qqq inning equivelent perfomance would be qqq earned runs thus his era is qqq to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by qqq era er ip qqq an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game here are some examples if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game i hope this explains things for you .
i tell you steve stone is like a prophet he must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because i ca n ' t understand why he ' s not actually back in the game itself the other day he called sosa ' s homerun against the sox and claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the score was qqq qqq in the qqq so yesterday he notices that sosa ' s ahead in the count against maddux and says this is a fastball situation and sosa will be looking for it but this is also the spot where maddux throws the straight change sure enough sosa gets ahead on it and pops it up to the infield stoney for cubs manager !
i was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive evidence that the puck _ did _ cross the line and the replays i saw showed fairly conclusively that the puck did _ not _ cross the goal line at any time anyway somebody screwed up .
is n ' t he the guy who took shots at jagr and ulf in a recent sports illustrated i ' m not familiar with cherry ' s work and maybe he ' s known for sarcasm but i ' d have to wonder about him doing commentary for the pens .
if anyone knows of such a site could they please send it to me also thanks
that ' s true but according to your stats chicago has just as good a record as toronto it ' s interesting that you should list toronto ahead of chicago .
williams does not like hitting cleanup secondly bonds and clark in that order are a lot more productive with runners in scoring position than matt i am streaky free swinger williams .
um how many games have the orioles won he is or will be no currently there ' s no room for him in the rotation key is having a most impressive april abbott is pitching well perez is back wickman has pitched his way into the rotation and is holding his spot with an outstanding performance his last time out and kamieniecki is n ' t doing too poorly himself if the yankees find themselves in need of a starter militello will get another chance until then he ' ll have to wait in line .
wake up and smell the norris rick zombo was traded to the blues for vince riendo sp last season .
can someone send me ticket ordering information for the following teams baltimore philadelphia and boston also if you have a home schedule available can you tell me the dates for all home games between qqq and between qqq and if any of these games are promotion nights or special discount nights thanks ron ps and also who the opponents are for these games do not reply to this account please reply to ronc @ vnet . ibm . com

well maddux looked excellent as the braves shutout the cubs qqq qqq justice drove in the only run with an rbi single in the first get ready for him to have a monster year he is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye if he stays healthy which he should his back is full strength this year he should get over qqq rbi and close to qqq hr in another note the marlins got off to a good start beating the dodgers i believe the score was qqq qqq but i ' m not sure i wish them and the rockies well this year hell i think it would be funny to watch the dodgers hit the cellar again this year .
does any one out there listen to wfan for those of you who do not know what i am talking about it is an all sports radio staion in new york on a clear night the signal reaches up and down the east coast in particular i want to know how len berman and mike lupica ' s show is i go to school in virginia so i ca n ' t listen when there are on during the day just wondering jonathan alboum uva
but i have to agree boston is a good team but streaky they put together a great streak to capture first place in the adams but for what they have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round and might not make it out of it i would love to see the sabres win the first round even though i bet on the bruins a qqq oh well perhaps i should start betting against the sabres more often )
i was playing this golf game and something interesting happened on the qqq hole i drove the ball down the fairway when the ball was in mid flight the game completely froze a couple seconds later the screen went completely black with an error message in large bubble letters that said division by zero i thought it was funny considering i am a computer programmer and i had never seen an error like this on an actual video game system like sega or nintendo or even atari or intellevision years ago oh yeah after the message there was also what must have been an address in hexadecimal i forget the exact hex code that was given has this happened to anyone else it must have my game should n ' t have been the only one to do this .

one t in eddie mathews because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near making up for the large difference in hitting their average seasons using their combined average qqq ab bb per qqq games years ab h r qqq qqq hr rbi tb bb avg obp slg ops santo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq robinson qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq fielding we have per qqq games at third years p a dp e pct santo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq robinson qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq even if robinson ' s extra qqq putouts qqq assists and qqq dps are taken to mean he was responsible for qqq more outs in the field that does n ' t make up for the extra qqq outs he made at the plate not to mention the fewer total bases the difference of qqq in ops should be decreased by about qqq to account for wrigley but a qqq difference is still considerable the thorn palmer ratings are adjusted adjusted stolen fielding total production batting runs base runs runs rating santo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq robinson qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq usual disclaimers about t & p ' s fr apply but they really should n ' t be way off the mark in this comparison at least it ' s better than fielding percentage carney lansford has a qqq qqq best all time but qqq fr dead last of all time also since this total rating compares players to league average instead of replacement level robinson should be awarded an extra qqq or so for playing qqq more games he had a great career but i would prefer santo ' s plus qqq years of a replacement level qqq but i would knock traynor off the list and replace him by stan hack that ' s a similar story hack ' s far better hitting outweighs traynor ' s superior fielding graig nettles and buddy bell would also be better choices imho of course though some recent net discussion supports this point of view should n ' t that be right field ?
owen only has one error so far i believe that seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches he will have a fine fielding percentage like always the problem is that he does n ' t reach anything that is n ' t hit straight at him this would n ' t be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to kelly gruber or robin ventura but the third baseman for the yankees is wade boggs who should have moved across the diamond last year i ' ve only seen one game abbott ' s first start but there were three balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality defensive players instead they were charged as hits against abbott .
actually messier was invited but declined due to nagging injuries keenan and messier have always gotten along keenan dumped steve yzerman from the last canada cup team even though yzerman had endured the training camp when messier who had missed essentially the entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the last moment .
kc news was doing a report on that they said that mcrae is really a batting coach and not a manager but for some reason he took the job whatever the reason the royals need a new manager now while it is too late .
did they move probert back to defense why did i see him parking his ass in front of potvin all night somebody is going to have to discipline probert if the leafs want to win the series perhaps a fresh clark should hit the ice at the end of a long probert shift and straigten him out for a while -
well druce pretty much sucked when he was with the caps he had one good playoffs not season oh well the caps are notorious for making stupid trades anyway as can be seen with the cicarelli and hrivnak trades sigh in another note i ' d have to say the caps biggest surprise was cote as many caps fans had been expecting a lot from bondra already .
from dean yes you ' re right after going home and reading the paper i got the full details that ' s what i get for making a post based on wduq ' s news i should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong .
i would n ' t give baserunning that much value the above effect is clear but there are other effects as well if olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold at third thus olerud ' s doubles have more advancement value than alomar ' s of course alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams no team in the qqq ' s ran much but some teams certainly had faster players than others still the current runs created formulas work just as well in the qqq ' s for all teams bill james gives the qqq qqq senators as an example they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in qqq stole qqq bases with qqq times caught stealing yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created .
aw just take a moment to digest it and i ' m sure you ' ll see the humour .

you think that ' s bad i ' m in bowling green oh and we get abc from toledo well the cable co decided to totally pre empt the game no tape delay no nothing for a stupid telethon hockey is very big around here too i had to listen to my penguins win on my car radio out in the parking lot i can just be thankful for a strong radio because being qqq miles from pittsburgh the reception usually is n ' t good at all i ca n ' t believe i picked it up during the middle of the day .
bob i think that stark does this sort of thing as a joke not as a serious prediction i do n ' t really see why we should shoot him for that the guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming how great the royals chances are in the al west since all evidence indicates that they are n ' t joking and actually believe it .
does anybody else think that ws stats should become part of a player ' s career stats why not ?
the phillies were picked to be in first someone replied that the people who picked them were the same people who picked the mets last year my reply yeah that may be true but this is the phillies .
you ' re right thomas gonzalez sheffield and griffey do n ' t even begin to compare with ripken boggs and gwynn so no wonder alomar gets so much attention sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was terrible so was his sophomore year national league pitchers are much better pitchers that certainly explains sheffield ' s qqq hm are you confusing have era ' s that are qqq lower because they do n ' t face dh ' s with much better ?
uh gerald i think he was joking .

writes oh probably ms nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for qqq and qqq a very nice piece of information ms nichols who knows she may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half a run less being scored per game and the games taking qqq minutes longer something is being done now that was n ' t done ten years ago which is extending the games by qqq minutes ms nichols thinks it ' s more pitches given the increasing specialization of pitchers it would n ' t surprise me if it ' s not simply more pitches though i do n ' t think it ' s unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back then i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones the problem is who decides whether that time is wasted you do n ' t seem to think it is at all right now i think it is although i have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the difference in mounds between the field and pen but who knows if the rules get changed maybe something i did n ' t foresee will happen to change my mind but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing or else nothing will be changed rg
is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad i ca n ' t remember how many times during the penguins devils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner now the last time i watched a football game they did n ' t show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown is it just me ?

on tuesday when it was raining in chicago espn provided bonus hockey coverage now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the ny wash ot was replaced with the angels game people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the u . s the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they ca n ' t skip the baseball game why do n ' t you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get well partly because i as an ardent fan of both sports would rather see game qqq of the nhl playoffs than game qqq of qqq of the mlb season even if the bb game involves the red sox espn may have had contractual obligations i understand that part but it ' s a bit inaccurate to call us selfish just because we want to watch the watch the game we love am i as a baseball fan selfish when i get pissed a cbs for showing approximately one game per month i do n ' t think so while espn may have contractual obligations we as their consumers have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us there ' s certainly nothing wrong with that .

us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools often do n ' t get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition i and i ' m sure others too would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away basically all we need are goal scorers and assists do n ' t bother with times penalties shots etc this would make a lot of pool obsessed people very happy i guess with the senators out golfing now the local papers have lost interest thanks kd .

there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages and of course they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time another thing that bothers me is the points system percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is american or not is irrelevant even if orr could n ' t have contributed without the likes of norris you would have to agree that norris could n ' t have contributed without the likes of orr and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made the more meaningful contribution it does n ' t look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it -

qqq hitting hawks tried to outmuscle blues but could not do it instead blues matched hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of them in game qqq scud line shanahan butcher and zombo particularly took turns bashing favorite targets like chelios qqq skating when the hawks tried to outskate blues they could not do that either nelson emerson finally showed up and skated circles around flat footed chicago defense hedican felsner ron wilson and others also proved that with old cement skaters like goulet and keith brown blues could lap chicago in a qqq m relay race i agree with qqq but you are wrong about qqq in fact the only point where the hawks in any way matched the blues was when they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate the blues they scored and took the lead too bad it was game qqq and they then took some stupid penalties when the hawks skated they outskated the blues and took control .
and then cosper @ seq . uncwil . edu kit cosper quoth a comment made by one of the braves announcers attributed to an anonymous player after friday night ' s game i ' m sorry we did n ' t tie it up i wanted to see some more umpiring just about sums it up sure like ron gant was n ' t completely out of line if i were hirschbeck i would have ejected in order ron gant every single last brave who came onto the field and possibly bobby cox depending on the language he used since cox was the only brave rung up i suspect i would have thrown him out too you simply can not show up an umpire like ron gant did it is disrespectful of not only the home plate umpire but of the dignity of the game .

game two of the detroit toronto series will be a rougher game i believe that clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars i believe that probert will take exception to this and a fight between clark and probert will result i know this sounds kind of ridiculous but i know game two toronto will come out hitting any takers on this issue ?
all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasny master of a thousand dishes power play captain stevens take a look at the numbers or play with them and see for yourselves .
there are several reasons for this difference the main reason is that good hitters in their prime such as frank thomas and danny tartabull are rarely regular dh ' s even if they ca n ' t field it ' s more commonly a place to put aging veterans another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field i would expect such players to hit worse as dh ' s than they did during the rest of the season a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield do n ' t hit as well as dh ' s for some reason reggie jackson was a good example in five years as a rf dh for the angels he hit like the old reggie when he was in right the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only a player who plays qqq games in right and qqq at dh will count only in the right fielders averages this makes sense you might also look at it another way although the average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder the replacement level offensive performance is certainly lower if you are a left fielder but ca n ' t hit well enough to keep a job anywhere then you certainly ca n ' t hit well enough to keep a job at dh .
since roger is a canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball i am gon na try to explain it to him in terms of hockey according to his logic i can say that since qqq bob errey is better than wayne gretzky hey errey contributed to qqq cups while good old wayne has won nothing i think the kings should trade gretzky for errey what do you think roger )
and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other team captain trivia would be appreciated luc robitaille was captain of the kings the first third of the season until the great one came back from his disc injury it was kind of awkward but melrose appointed anointed tgo as captain immediately upon his return after which he did not score a goal for something like qqq games i think luc should have remained captain all season .

last year brein taylor was in a ball probably at tampa in the florida state league i believe he began this year in aa which is albany hopefully george wo n ' t rush him and he ' ll be allowed to progress at his own rate to aaa and then to the bronx this guy is the real thing .
exactly my point if you ' d watch games more closely you ' d see a lot of goons going after him ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical players for pgh are left alone ulf plays rough hockey but only when other players are putting the rush on mario or jagr if you want to say anyone on the penguins is a cheap shot or a goon say it ' s jennings or caufield don ' tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players ca n ' t beat the pens even when they take dives like gartner to try for the cheap penalties hey that ' s fine if a player does something stupid he should be penalized including ulf or mario you ' re not likely to see that happen or anyone else for that matter it ' s pointless to say any one person is a cheap shot goon because you ' ll see everyone take a cheap shot now and then especially if you ' resomeone who is shadowed as much as ulf is .

tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that montreal will send qqq players qqq million including vin damphousse and brian bellows to phillidelphia phillie will send eric lindros to ottawa and ottawa will give it ' s first round pick to montreal if this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa gets to choose qqq overall can ottawa afford lindros salary personally i ca n ' t see philli giving up lindros for anything they did n ' t give away that much to quebec just to trade him away again not to mention that lindros seems to be a huge draw in phillie and that he represents a successful future for the franchise ottawa may be better off taking the qqq players qqq from montreal for the pick .
to put it mildly as i watched the flyers demolish toronto last night qqq qqq i realized that no matter how good the leafs qqq line may be they ' ll need one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs and of course a healthy felix potvin .
no patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc well the key does n ' t quite fit if you ' re montreal the dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but let ' s face it he literally left his feet to throw an elbow blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow he even saw the whole shot dammit besides stewart evened things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot montreal played a solid game although they still do n ' t know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more normally i would say that any team that blows a qqq lead with less than five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads but i do n ' t think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first quebec goal roy is paid big money to play he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic ' s shot demers should start racicot in the next game if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two and maybe this article if possible i did n ' t think the wrap around was as bad as the second goal i also did n ' t think scott young should have gotten around the defender ca n ' t remember who in the first place but you are correct it should n ' t have gone in regardless yep moog looked bad on mogilny ' s goal with five seconds left in the second imo how about neely though holy shit what a player speaking of great players man oh man can quebec skate i have n ' t seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time watching them break out of their zone especially sundin is a treat to watch they remind me of the red army but i still hate the team on the rest of the games did n ' t st louis winning goal come on a powerplay penalties will cost chicago dearly especially against detroit same goes for calgary very very undisciplined when marty mcsorely is waving guys to the bench to avoid fights you know something ' s up new jersey was overmatched terreri ' s heroics notwithstanding mario is unbelievable and jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs but i hate that team anyway .
i know that there was n ' t other games on the schedule but espn sometimes shows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot .
does anyone know if the twins games are broadcast in good ole ames iowa ?
news for the first time all season the flames are now injury free the only player remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who even when healthy is not a major part of the team trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against san jose he potted his first of the year in that game and has also scored goals in both game qqq and game qqq against los angeles thoughts on game qqq the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with los angeles qqq qqq on sunday afternoon they seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals they physically dominated the kings but that was the only area they dominated in the game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young inexperienced l . a defence and the shaky kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box particularily stupid was theoren fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren rychel ' s face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss despite his well publicized poor record in afternoon games he got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds in fact marty mcsorley ' s goal actually went in off chris dahlquist ' s skate in front of the net thoughts on game qqq the flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice the first period was fairly even with the edge going to the kings but calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a qqq qqq win the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in game qqq but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one calgary also went qqq on the powerplay while l . a only went qqq and gave up a shorthanded goal to joel otto l . a ' s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided the kings powerplay failed them when they needed it most in the qqq and qqq periods the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary ' s qqq goal charlie huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute first craig berube of calgary took a five minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason granato drew a minor for some strange reason turtling perhaps this was followed qqq seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason hardy and yawney went toe to toe and both got double minors gregson thought that musil turtling amounted to fighting but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing where ' s this guy from upcoming games friday april qqq at l . a sunday april qqq at l . a tuesday april qqq home to l . a thursday april qqq at l . a if necessary saturday may qqq home to l . a if necessary injuries c carey wilson indefinite with recurring knee injuries dec qqq qqq qqq calgary flames final regular season statistics pos name gp g a pts pim qqq rw theoren fleury qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c robert reichel qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d gary suter qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw gary roberts qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c joe nieuwendyk qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq rw sergei makarov qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d al macinnis qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c joel otto qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw paul ranheim qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq rw greg paslawski qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq rw ron stern qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw brent ashton qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw chris lindberg qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d roger johansson qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d trent yawney qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d frank musil qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c brian skrudland qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw craig berube qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d michel petit qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d kevin dahl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c carey wilson i qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d chris dahlquist qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d alexander godynyuk qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq rw todd harkins qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw paul kruse qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq g jeff reese qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq d greg smyth qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq g mike vernon qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq rw thomas forslund qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq c shawn heaphy qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lw patrick lebeau qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq g andrei trefilov qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq

that ' s the trouble what peak years he wavers between excellent and very good with no real bell shaped pattern in there qqq was a fine year qqq and qqq were merely really good with the yankees qqq i think was the best that was the one with the qqq ba of course qqq was n ' t bad either he ' s been in the bigs since qqq with a one year intermission for surgery though he does n ' t have the mix of skills that pete rose did he ' s like pete rose in one way he ' s not a natural hitter winfield ' s swing used to be the ugliest thing in new york and that includes the gulf + western building but his sheer athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot fascinating player to watch even now not obviously great in any one way but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising levels .
educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year lankford injured himself in a previous game and torre was resting him as far as the whitten gilkey controversy whitten adds some more needed power and if jordan continues to hit the way he has been gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough sam
more like philadelphia making dust out of dead leafs roger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions they got whitewashed by a last place team granted philly is pretty decent but the best team in the cambell conference would have beaten a last place team .

yes these last couple of months the kinngs have failed to show up in about one game in five presumably last night was that one game in five .
the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a qqq qqq shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day to day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round qqq overall of the qqq entry draft qqq years old qqq qqq lbs in qqq games with the tri city americans he had qqq goals qqq assists and qqq pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk lindros recchi beranek brind ' amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy acton brown galley mcgill yushkevich cronin carkner hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the qqq period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they ' d be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind ' amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa ' s body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs qqq ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at qqq the flyers lowly qqq ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind ' amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at qqq the leafs could n ' t get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf ' s blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at qqq shots were qqq qqq flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind ' amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at qqq with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke ' s qqq qqq season the second best one season total for a flyer at qqq eric moves up to qqq all time in flyers rookie scoring with qqq points mike eastwood took down al conroy at qqq to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at qqq not much happened on the qqq on qqq although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at qqq bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at qqq to set up a qqq on qqq the replay showed that hawgood ' s stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but did n ' t get anything home shots were qqq qqq flyers the flyers were content with the qqq goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first qqq or so minutes of the period but could n ' t get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared qqq each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and qqq each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at qqq terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at qqq on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the qqq minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it ' s side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind ' amour tripped up gilmour at qqq to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at qqq no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at qqq rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got qqq each for slashing to set up another qqq on qqq mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill ' s face the flyers were not happy with that at all qqq qqq al conroy paired up with qqq qqq berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood qqq cross check game clark carkner qqq each berehowski and conroy qqq each fighting at qqq so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind ' amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at qqq that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board qqq qqq flyers shots were qqq qqq flyers in the qqq probably the strongest game i ' ve seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number qqq for soderstrom all since qqq tied for qqq most in the nhl but he ' s played fewer games than belfour qqq or the goalie i ca n ' t remember that he ' s tied with next up it ' s the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers can not be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to qqq points on the season in qqq games last year they had qqq points in qqq games qqq under qqq so they need at least qqq points in their last qqq games to improve on that only by percentage points qqq under in qqq is better than qqq under in qqq tragic number holds at qqq points with qqq games left the tragic number for qqq is qqq points i watched the rangers blow a qqq qqq third period lead at home to lose qqq qqq before i finished this up why qqq points instead of qqq well the flyers will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with qqq games against the caps so i guess qqq place could be the goal for the team to focus on flyers team record watch eric lindros qqq goals

tom prince is a qqq year old no hit catcher think of him as a young dann bilardello i ca n ' t begin to fathom why the pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy who ' s been in aaa most of the last qqq seasons the pirates released kirk gibson last year because prince was out of options then eventually sent prince down anyway and he cleared waivers without a peep he ' s another year older and still ca n ' t hit why do they think he would n ' t clear waivers now why would they care ?
i should have guessed it ' s time for the annual pittsburgh penguins whine a thon bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the devils in game qqq i ' m sorry mr bowman you ' re a great coach but those cheap shots were nothing compared to what ' s going to come also i guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white it ' s amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do ps nice dive on that high stick mario everyone knew it was a high stick you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent for later .
for an expansion team i ' m pretty sure i would go with the rings as long as their salaries and ages were n ' t too high i would want the fans to be able to identify the players i would like a championship attitude in the clubhouse as for larkin and griffin salaries aside i would have to consider which player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory past performance age and attitude would all be integral to my decision i certainly would n ' t just haul out my copy of gillete and pick larkin as many others would and unlike many others who post to this group i hardly consider myself quali fied to make those kinds of decisions i have never been able to believe it about myself to tell you the truth it ' s like banging your head against a stone wall -

the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend the qqq mets and qqq orioles are prime examples not the cubs i root for the cubs because i feel sorry for them but basically they are dogs the pirates today are a great example of an underdog if the rockies and marlins compete they will be underdogs the north stars trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdog ' s journey the cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much less than america ' s team .

i ' m familiar with the telethon situation an individual on compuserve was also victimized and was equally pissed that was a local television station contract which could not be broken for that item i strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on them supposedly one station had told my friend that they have received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less incentive to pre empt hockey telecasts in future the contract was written when the pathetic wlaf was in that time slot )
i do n ' t have a history handy but i do n ' t recall that the preponderance of roy ' s come from winning teams in fact i think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins am i wrong and he is not necessarily on a losing team while the angels staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank you snow is playing great salmon is learning to make the adjustments easley appears fine but even if he ' s not flora is ready to come up between gonzales and gruber they ' ll manage the hot corner polonia and curtis are steady and heady even myers and orton are contributing personally i think they can finish over qqq which makes them a winning team the beastmaster

i think that mike foligno was the captain of the sabres when he got traded to the leafs also was n ' t rick vaive the captain of the leafs when he got traded to chicago with steve thomas for ed olcyzk and someone speaking of the leafs i believe that darryl sittler was their captain he ' d torn the c off his jersey but i think he re claimed the captaincy later on when he was traded to the flyers oh yeah of course gretzky was the captain of the oilers before he was traded was n ' t he ?

roger maynard shares his views with the masses on bob gainey and life in general it was bryan trottier not denis potvin it was a vicious boarding from behind trottier was given a major but roger what the hell does this have to do with gainey ' s skill as a hockey player if probert smashes gilmour ' s head into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment of gilmour ' s skills i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter i think gainey would be honoured to know that you ' ve included him on this list i also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey game pluggers are an integral part of any team the selke is designed to acknowledge their contribution i think that most people understand that it ' s not the nobel prize so settle down congenially as always jd james david david @ student . business . uwo . ca
perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen for most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity it was nowhere near the most exciting game unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits at first i immediately thought qqq and a game because the hit _ looked _ much more severe from an intent to injure perspective than it was after seeing the replay i ' d say it deserved qqq qqq minutes for boarding it was careless any way you slice it if stewart had replay i do not think chaisson would have gotten qqq and the game this no call was bullshit i agree i admire stewart for letting them go but probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty i ' ve never seen probert whine either he does n ' t need to now if probie decides to put wendel through the boards he ' s probably gone right this was also bullshit but once again no replay it was rouse btw i ' m really pissed that the linesmen did n ' t correct the call either it ' s b . s when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake yes the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit loss i picked the leafs to win game qqq on emotion and adrenalin but the wings have no excuses for game qqq they should be the superior team the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting qqq for putting his stick in somebody ' s eye that was _ the _ most dangerous stick infraction i have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league _ knows _ he ' s an asshole when it comes to stickwork four lousy minutes bullshit call murray should send the tape in or a wing should hammer the living shit out of him .
that ' s why we have expansion to create more jobs nhl teams ca n ' t afford to import role players from europe they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players i ' d love to see a european nhl division but ca n ' t see it happen for some time there ' s simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like germany italy and france while sweden and finland probably ca n ' t afford to shell out qqq for tickets the way american canadian fans do call it the minnesota north stars effect scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the nhl the national hockey league should love the idea though pan european tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the american networks likely never will pay .
i was watching the dodgers marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me first is that the way the sun was shining in miami it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball in comparison wrigley field in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans the second and most important was the fans i like these guys gals i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins the way they were cheering i thought it was the afc playoffs of course opening day may have a lot to do with it but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement we ' ll find out friday how denver bronco fans respond .
uh right you also forgot that you ca n ' t get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base what fraction of all runs come on solo hr most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good i use the phrase happened to be advisedly lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutch rbi whatever situations and what they ' ve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent there are no clutch hitters people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position i agree .

everyone keeps talking about european expansion by qqq thinking wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe for those that do n ' t know the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted would european fans put up with our if you ' ve paid you can play attitude how long would they support teams that are run on ranger based corporate thinking i use the term lightly we do n ' t need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa ' s record every year qqq haha sorry had ta say it if hockey and other pro sports had a similar system to europe maybe teams like the rangers would be forced to compete or get demoted the fourth division we ' d have many more teams centres that are n ' t as big like halifax or adirondack ok so halifax is n ' t a good example would eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division unlike ottawa sj edmonton etc fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty or penalized for their neglect and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup i can dream ca n ' t i look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan problems just someone who thinks our system really sucks barfly feel free to flame me my account ends today hahahaha )
the term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description although right now i ' d expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle what the braves lack however is an offensive stopper somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump there ' s just no one there the braves got rid of their best pure hitter lonnie smith and only terry pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit oh and another thing that worries me ron gant seems to have slowed down a step that ' s scary a slow ron gant does n ' t have much going for him .
disclaimer this is for fun in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort using the qqq defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri i ' ve figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen hits stolen have been redefined as plays kurt stillwell would not have made ok i realize that ' s unfair kurt ' s probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor but let ' s put it this way if we replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurt ' s qqq out making ability how many extra hits would go by to try and correlate it to reality a little more i ' ve calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make by the same method i ' ve calculated net double plays and net extra bases doubles and triples let by finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense onbase plus slug which should represent the player ' s total contribution to the team so do n ' t take it too seriously the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article the short version definition of terms hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented as a rate dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player ' s total contribution national league name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops alicea l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sandberg r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq thompson r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lind j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq doran b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq deshields d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq harris l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lemke m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq morandini m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq randolph w qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq biggio c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq stillwell k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ordered by dops qqq sandberg qqq alicea qqq thompson qqq deshields qqq doran qqq nl average qqq biggio qqq harris qqq randolph qqq morandini qqq lemke qqq lind qqq stillwell american league name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops fletcher s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reed j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ripken b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq baerga c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq blankenship l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq miller k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq alomar r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq knoblauch c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bordick m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq kelly p qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq whitaker l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reynolds h qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sax s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sojo l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq order by dops qqq baerga qqq alomar qqq fletcher qqq whitaker qqq blankenship qqq miller qqq knoblauch qqq reed qqq bordick qqq al average qqq kelly qqq ripken qqq reynolds qqq sojo qqq sax more discussion dcon formula nhs ndp / pa nhs ndp neb / ab why such a bizzare formula basically it ' s designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are factored into slg that ' s why i used pa and ab as the divisors for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base qqq dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic

a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was disturbed with the call a reasonable umpire would have realized that there was a qqq game in progress with two outs in the ninth what ron gant did was try to regain his composure what a normal baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire and since you ca n ' t argue balls and strikes he would have been ejected from the game ron gant by trying to avoid such a conflict was penalized for showing some restraint incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as gant requested if the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike and gant would not have been so upset if the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help finally the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so called efforts to speed up the game the game was played very quickly it was just at qqq hours when the stuff happened in the ninth and the only delays in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires other than deion having to clean garbage off the field .
jason lee asks you must have heard wrong his arm is still sore he has n ' t gone on the dl but he may managmenet is treating him as a day to day situation his doctors thought that he was ready and they had him throw in colorado but his arm was n ' t up to the strain he is throwing every day but he ' s just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet this is based on an interview that he gave on wfan ny radio on thursday qqq )

actually that ' s based on the nhl ' s history of qqq games the statstical odds of winning one straight game qqq two straight games qqq three straight games qqq qqq straight games qqq the odds of the penguins winning qqq straight games in the playoffs was qqq of course this does n ' t include weighted average but the pens beating the devils qqq straight a weaker team along with beating the rangers qqq straight a much stronger team has made the act balanced out that ' s about right for boston the odds of winning are probably closer to qqq with weighted average since buffalo ' s record is n ' t as good and boston has a stronger team enough about my qba probabilities though it ' s just goes to prove anything is possible if you integrate that to debbie gibson moog gets about ' s out of qqq for his performance from me i give blue qqq starts fuhr has been too tough buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in time i mean after all buffalo is qqq wins qqq losses in their last qqq it ' s very frustrating to lose and you ' ve got ta say something actually it ' s not about winning or losing it is how you play the game but when the competition is magnified to this level qqq of the people only care about who wins or loses i think buffalo will win in qqq it ' s not like boston is getting blown away they lost qqq ot games with a different bounce they could easily be up qqq qqq good point here chicago ' s in deep trouble tonight the hawks have a bad past history of winning the division and losing early when they do n ' t finish qqq they do okay .
sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases what competition did alomar have sandberg came in a year after ripken and the same year as boggs gwynn and the other magicians so less attention was given to sandberg alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre besides the numbers do n ' t count national league pitchers are much better pitchers larry on someone elses account -

it would help if his obp were higher than his batting average yes the april qqq usa today lists le grand chapeau as having a qqq batting average and a qqq obp that ' s on qqq hitting with qqq zip nil nada walks the reason a lot of us are down on galarraga is that he ' s has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability except for drawing walks if he hit qqq for say even qqq ab ' s i ' d be convinced that there was a real change in his ability if he did it with an obp avg i ' d not only be amazed but i ' d make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game but what do qqq ab ' s prove look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season player avg ab blauser qqq qqq grace qqq qqq milligan qqq qqq conine qqq qqq lansing qqq qqq slaught qqq qqq are any of these guys really that good well in a word no how significant is galarraga ' s average at the qqq ab level a hit is worth about qqq if he ' d had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play he ' d be in the qqq range if he goes qqq in his next game he ' s all the way down to qqq in one game come back in june let ' s talk then it ' s history greg andres history is that he does n ' t walk much because he swings at bad pitches so his average is n ' t very good qqq ab ' s does n ' t mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand especially when there ' s ample evidence qqq bb in qqq that his basic hitting approach has n ' t changed yeah he might suddenly have turned into a qqq hitter who never walks but do n ' t bet the rent money on it mike jones aix high end development mjones @ donald . aix . kingston . ibm . com

can the sabres win two more games against the bruins i think game three in buffalo will be the most important of the series if the sabres lose that game the party will be over it will be hello next year the key for the remaining games in the series will be whether fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if mogilny can continue skate by the bruins he has shown demonstrated excellent speed finally the sabres appear to have shown up for the post season .
farewell minnesota fans get stuffed dallas stars as the north stars fade to black i hope that minneapolis st paul are not long without an nhl team it just seems right that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well the loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans though the start of the qqq qqq season made it look real bad for a while i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in qqq i got it to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up what a glorious season that was for the north stars dwarf
do you really have that much information on him really i do n ' t know you tell me what percentage of players reach or exceed their mle ' s in their rookie season we ' re talking about qqq you know if that were your purpose maybe offerman spent qqq getting acclimated if you will the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant for a stat head i ' m amazed that you put any credence in spring training did you notice who he got those qqq hits off of or are you going to tell me that it does n ' t make a difference wait a minute i missed something here first forget keith mitchell are you saying that a kid who moves from aa to aaa and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors if a player does well at aa and then does not improve at aaa is n ' t that a sign that maybe he does n ' t belong in the bigs now keith mitchell as i recall no stat books handy surprise he jumped from aa to atlanta in qqq he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he did n ' t do very well at all now his career is in jeopardy so how does he fit in with your point good mle ' s in aa moved him right to the big club now he ' s one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball duh well i ' ve cast my lot certainly you may understand better how good lopez is and i may overvalue experience but neither one of us runs a baseball team the beastmaster
please pardon my ignorance if this is well known but what is the current rule maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make and award a balk if he exceeds it i ' d have another question who would operate the pitch clock one of the umpires add another one to the crew i ' m not sure i like this idea i think it would severely diminish the number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play one of my personal favorites ahhh i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the f key eh obviously from what i wrote above i like this idea it may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag since the pitcher knows he does n ' t have very many chances to pick off the runner so he may hurry too much i ' d rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule so i suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too i remember in little league if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter ' s box even for a moment we were automatically out that may be a little harsh for the majors but seriously how about putting a limit on the batters being able to step out take several dozen practice swings pound their shoes scratch their balls etc maybe forcing them to stay in the batter ' s box would n ' t be such a bad idea that could save a few minutes .

actually i could care less what his salary is it has something to do with the fact that we live in america and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain if sandy alderson and the haas family willingly negotiate a salary of qqq million per year with rickey i could n ' t care less but what really gets my goat is the bullshit he spouted in spring training about well sometimes i may not play as hard or might be hurt more often in a place where i ' m not appreciated this quote was in the chronicle about the second week of camp and strongly suggests that he was going to dog it all year if the ownership did n ' t kiss his butt and ante up some more money for god ' s sake rickey you signed a contract qqq years ago now honor it and play say all you want to about steve garvey and believe me i hated him too but at least when he put his signature on a piece of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up .
can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors let ' s for argument ' s sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age qqq or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing i ' m serious i tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better but i ' d like to look at players for whom this theory did n ' t work if there are any i ' d prefer players within the last qqq years or so because then i can look up their minor league stats it ' s important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers let ' s kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although there does n ' t seem to have been any damage to his career jay bell was given qqq pas in the major leagues at age qqq and performed well below what you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season he got qqq pas the next year at age qqq and still underperformed however the next year at age qqq his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job and has been there ever since it ' s really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was performed quite well in aaa during this time rather than being rushed cleveland might have been better off i suppose because they might have been less likely to give up on him yes if you bring a player up early he ' s likely going to struggle but does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts performing up to expectations ?
hmmmm i ' m not sure this is true according to mike lang and good old stagie along with the rest of the tv crews in pittsburgh they winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark i would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular season games .
to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota from what i have seen in the local news tv and newspaper various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team a columnist for the st paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the issue there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin cities first the sites target center civic center st paul and yes even the met center the columnist was pretty confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will ultimately win out he argued however that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably without the inter site competition the columnist sorry i ca n ' t remember his name believes that minnesota would have a team by the qqq qqq season also because of the situation with the timberwolves things will be delayed until unless the city of minneapolis takes over the target center however they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for conventions and short term events even with hockey at target to add to this mess a study qqq to qqq months is going to be conducted on the future viability of the met center which obviously delays the process even further i hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met which may happen regarding possible candidates the three teams are hartford tampa bay and new jersey i would prefer the devils minnesota ice demons although the lightning may have potential although it has n ' t been announced yet it looks like qqq neutral site games will be played at the target center next year apparently the devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible and i would n ' t be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either so minnesota may end up getting another team but it may take a few years go sabres !
went to the dodgers game tonight it was cap night astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home another single made the score qqq qqq cards lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster piazza homered in the first to make the score qqq qqq cards the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman by the fourth inning astacio had already made about qqq pitches but the score was still qqq qqq the dodger defense made several impressive plays piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third my heart sank in the qqq when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still qqq qqq dodger fans just knew it was over gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just qqq qqq innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen the qqq inning game had the same effect the next night so only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday gross lived up to his name he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it qqq qqq cards gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the qqq run had scored long before that meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning lee smith pitched the ninth he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year the final score cardinals qqq runs on qqq hits dodgers qqq runs on qqq hits .

just curious roger but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league how come you have n ' t made a living out of it there must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field i ' m sure you ' d be of great help to say the leafs as an assistant coach or a scout or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator i might be wrong of course and you already have .

hi according to my always questionable newspaper there ' s a silver dollar being minted in canada the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the stanley cup now i know full well what coins are used every day in canada i can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now in fact my question is since the loon is the only dollar coin that i know is legal tender is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value or what is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet with no chance of it being circulated if it is an uncirculated coin what ' s the current cost and what ' s its potential value just curious if no one knows i ' ll take this to soc . culture . canada and rec . collecting or whatever it is thanks again
and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other team captain trivia would be appreciated was n ' t ron francis captain of the whalers when he was traded to pittsburgh and rick tochett was the captain of the flyers when traded to the pens recently caleb and let us not forget that the new jersey devils traded captain kirk muller for stephen richer and chorske

let ' s be careful here if players performance was completely random in clutch no clutch then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not so good every year with two years worth of data you ' d have qqq of the players good each year qqq bad each year and qqq would have one good and one bad year we have qqq players for qqq years qqq just flipping a coin you ' d expect qqq players to be good all qqq years and qqq to be bad every year this is what we actually get no of good years qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq clutch performers qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq coin flip random qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non clutch performance was completely random if there was anything to clutch hitting at least in this definition that had any predictive capability you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin further if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations say qqq standard deviation from the mean more than one year the random explanation still looks good in the four years qqq that i looked at the data from elias there were qqq qqq players with a minimum of qqq qqq at bats in clutch situations that were qqq sigma from the mean two different years of those qqq qqq players qqq qqq of them changed sign between the two years in other words they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year if it was just a random process you ' d expect those numbers to be qqq qqq everything that ' s been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data e . g john lowenstein probably never had a clutch ab against a left handed pitcher but he might well have had some in blowouts so that there would be a bias since his clutch abs would be more geared to his platoon advantage this is not a subject that has been glanced at casually a lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them with the exception of the elias study has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin self serving plug follows some of the flaws in the elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth coming sabr book _ the perfect game _ by taylor publishing the authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance so go bug your local bookstores now and maybe i can get enough to take my wife to dinner once harold
anyone know of a phillies mailing list out there they do n ' t get much coverage up here in grand rapids mi sob -
not necessarily it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas home road splits in qqq for an example i would guess that some of alomar ' s split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence there ' s no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter only because of t & p ' s bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league on a career basis i think t & p ' s fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure is n ' t the worst in baseball offensively t & p rate alomar much higher last year regarding the a vs b argument i ' ll just say they ' re both very good players with different strengths and a bright future .

a few weeks ago i posted about the phillies team personalities did anyone see the espn feature on the phils on monday night john kruk had a great line he was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury he said if they do they know we ' ll kick their ass the time i saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped when i saw it at they bleeped ass mitch williams talked about the team being a bunch of throwaways from other teams and that is why they are so close kruk said that they all get along this year last year he said they hated the pitchers i assume he was joking but he always keeps a straight face when he talks oh what a team rob koffler

after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team i thought i ' d pass along a story i heard recently this is second hand so i do n ' t know how true it is but i have no reason to doubt it either bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge hockey team the owner of the admirals sorry i ca n ' t remember his name either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the bradley center supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of qqq million was too high like i said i do n ' t know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if it ' s true do n ' t look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon the admirals are n ' t going to be forced out of the building and you wo n ' t see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nba ' s milwaukee bucks play there as well .

interesting article craig it ' s amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers no other business could ever get away with the qqq century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs i guess the owners look at baseball ' s high growth rate and ask why it ' s necessary to bring qqq century business practices into the game but they do n ' t realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans .

from another not so distressed but still wondering about a few things cardinal fan he ' s not the greatest this is true i saw it lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told torre he could pinch hit if they needed him to i wondered the same thing but giving joe the benefit of the doubt i ' d say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that he did n ' t trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run him alicea i was completely confused about maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher i do n ' t know anybody got an idea well so far i have n ' t seen much to say whiten should n ' t be playing but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play jordan ahead of him that i do n ' t quite understand yup i looked for this on the replay too if i ' m joe torre i ' m going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one he ' s got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe a hot hitter coming up there ' s no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands it ' s his job to watch the play develop he should have known larkin was there to back up a bad throw that seemed inexcusable in my book btw i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation on the replay there ' s dent waving him around it looks like this might be a serious problem the card ' s were n ' t good base runners at all last year and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching well i ' m still hanging in there go redbirds woof woof dick detweiler

qqq blues shutout hawks again lead series qqq qqq it was a great atmosphere last night at the st louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game people were cheering the blues long before face off time and they kept going for the entire game my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players here ' s a game summary from the st louis post disptach enjoy by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at qqq p . m friday night the arena crowd of qqq paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph the fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read only god saves more than joseph it was a fitting tribute to joseph who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday blanking the blackhawks qqq qqq in game qqq of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a qqq qqq lead in the best of seven series the blackhawks have n ' t scored against joseph since the qqq mark of the second period of game qqq joseph has shut out the blackhawks for qqq minutes qqq seconds a blues record jacques plante held the previous record of qqq set in the first round of the qqq playoffs against the philadelphia flyers one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history the blues can wrap up their first sweep since qqq with a victory in game qqq a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in qqq when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game qqq when joseph had to make qqq saves this time the blues held the shots down to qqq and the blackhawks could n ' t touch joseph well they touched joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game but joseph and the blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way the blues grinders bob bassen rich sutter kevin miller and dave lowry wore down the blackhawks taking the visitors from chicago off their game the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities craig janney brett hull and nelson emerson scored getting one goal in each period hull assisted on janney ' s first period power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties checker miller set up hull ' s goal in the second period and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson who scored at qqq of the final period blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling sweep sweep sweep they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour bell four bell four they also chanted na na na na hey hey good bye such talk is a tad premature there ' s still one game left but the blues are on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heels the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play rich sutter leveled bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice chicago tried to retaliate but troy murray ' s decision to run into joseph backfired referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty the blues did n ' t get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer joseph stopped larmer ' s shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where joseph ' s butterfly style is deadly rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period two for hooking and one for holding but chicago got only two shots on goal as many as miller the blues penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedican ' s third penalty he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at qqq and gave the blues a two man advantage qqq later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and hull got it where he likes it in the high slot hull ' s shot hit belfour ' s right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to janney who poked it into the net at qqq for his first goal of the playoffs the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the blackhawks lost their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues bench chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice and marouelli slapped him with a qqq misconduct chicago survived the blues power play but the loss of chelios hurt he did n ' t return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return hull had increased the blues lead to qqq qqq deflecting in miller ' s crisp pass try as they might the blackhawks could n ' t get to joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him he stopped qqq shots in the second period and qqq more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice emerson ' s goal put the game away he went hard to the net and redirected felsner ' s pass .
sorry sherri but i ca n ' t agree with this particular incident while i ' m all for cutting down the number of chain rattles and other examples of rampant hargroving there was a difference here qqq since time immemorial batters have complained about calls so have pitchers and catchers usually nothing happens unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints hirschbeck was acting against expectations qqq it ' s not as if gant was in hirschbeck ' s face gant said something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away from hirschbeck as a hitter alibet of little consequence but with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call i ' d want a moment or two out of the box if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch and if i was really angry at the ump i ' d rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed especially at a key moment in the game when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant to step into the box imo at this point in time hirschbeck was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game gant was n ' t dawdling he had n ' t had a chance to dawdle and hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play gant resisted as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and hirschbeck called for the pitch at that point cox came out on the field the pitch was thrown and many other braves left the dugout cox was tossed protecting his player i was pleasantly surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game it ' s a small sample size but based on what i saw in that game mark hirschbeck has a hair trigger temper and a need to play god on the field not good qualities for an umpire i will keep my eyes open for future appearances of hirschbeck in the future in order to improve my sample size imo any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire .

and you know what there is no such method inherent in real life either so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we can not state with any level of objectivity that mother theresa has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin after all life on earth is a team effort have you tried glasses i find them quite useful after all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present it ' s too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result of that choice heck i ' d wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater accuracy than jeanne dixon and you know why because i have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level have you tried calling a kettle black in other words in your world you can not objectively state that jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al leiter last year in your world that may indeed be true fortunately in the world the rest of us occupy it ' s not i hope you never serve on a jury roger i think the rest of the jury would have to kill you there ' s no way i can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty you see there are qqq billion other people on this planet we have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it was n ' t for all the other people on the planet we have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet because living on this planet is a team effort and no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of that society that being case anything i have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity so i refuse to vote "
i ' ve had and still have a few aluminum sticks i got my first when i was qqq a christian and broke the shaft halfway through the season two years later i bought another a canadian at the beginning of the next season and i still have it i also have an easton that a friend was getting rid off after giving up the game i find that easton blades are easier to get but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable watch out for dried up bits of firewood that some stores pass off as blades in my experiences the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks but i ' ve only ever broken one aluminum shaft i like aluminum sticks the blades are quickly changed even on the bench if you have to on the downside the shaft wo n ' t break if you decide to impale yourself on it ciao mark s .
what the hell are u talking about espn showed pens devils game as advertised but the morons at espn should know that pens will kick devils ass and the game will be boring i ' d rather see boston buffalo game which seems to be an exciting series since noone had expected buffalo to get past the first round well let ' s hope they change their mind on thu ' s game and show some other game the pens series is really getting boring i want to see some exciting game no matter who wins if nhl wants a major network contract then they better put some brains in espn people .

would you say the same thing about the dodgers in qqq or qqq true cone is probably as good as drysdale and they have no koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of low scoring games etc and they did n ' t use relievers whereas jeff montgomery is having a super season for them that being said i still picked them qqq or so but i think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting there ' s more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching at least to me i wonder though which one do you people think would do better a team with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real order as the starters with sutter fingers and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig mays schmidt wagner and bench again you pick the order i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end even the best hitters can succeed only qqq of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts taking all the players in their prime they might throw qqq shutouts in a year and all the offense would have to do is get qqq run across i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results i would love to see that .
qqq simple reasons qqq batting williams ahead of bonds will create a left ( clark right ( williams left ( bonds situation in the middle of the batting order this makes it tougher for opposing manager to change pitchers qqq having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get more good pitches to hit this is important since he struggles so much with breaking balls opposing pitchers do n ' t want to walk williams to get to bonds .

with the kind of team montreal has now they can take the cup easily the only problem they have right now is that everyone is trying to steal the show and play alone they need some massive teamwork they are also in a little of a slump because long time hockey montreal canadiens announcer claude mouton died last tuesday and it was rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for qqq years but i know that is no excuse but if the habs manage to get some good teamwork and get into the spirit they should have no problem winning in may .

why ?
you ' re right about the signal being strong i live in west philadelphia and i can get fan almost perfectly it ' s a sports fans dream especially if that person is from ny and wants to hear about his teams while he ' s away at school as for lupica berman it ' s turned out to be lupica then berman neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show so ed coleman and dave sims old four hour slot was broken down into two seperate two hour show lupica from qqq qqq and berman from qqq qqq and they both happen to suck in comparison to eddie and dave come back guys like i said i live in philly so i can hear fan and / or wip whenever i want but i can not stand wip and it is n ' t because i loathe the philly sports teams the phillies are my favorite nl team yanks are favorite al and the eagles are n ' t too bad either there are two big problems qqq emphasis on the home teams especially the eagles unlike the fan hosts who can at least answer a question about an out of town team if a caller asks the wip hosts seem to have no clue about any team that does n ' t play on broad street also fans periodic sports updates every qqq minutes gives sports news and scores from around the country it ' s very rare to hear an out of town score being reported on wip qqq hosts with the exception of jody macdonald who i miss from his days at fan none of the hosts really seems to have both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on air presence the worst is gary cobb who seems to have been hired solely on the basis that he used to play for the eagles anyway that ' s my two cents on the whole fan vs wip battle .
foolish me and here i thought it had something to do with the fact that they were hitting against wakefield who had no kncukle to his ball that day and otto who has no stuff i wonder if reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup who also suddenly came alive those two games the beastmaster
were they palying football or baseball in detroit on saturday from looking at the school some people may think it was football between two games this week the tigers scored qqq runs the offense can carry them i hope the pitching will hold out i was at camden yards yesterday everytime i looked up the score was getting higher what a great site it was to see the tigers kicking butt while enjoying a game at camden yards go tigers and go tony phillips !
well if shit means going to the stanley cup finals a couple years ago i ' d rather be shit than a leaf fan .
nice post chuck but you made just one mistake bones is a right handed pitcher however hrbek ' s grand slam came off graehme lloyd a lefty .
it depends if you can get your old veterans cheap and if they can perform at a higher level than your young talent can now why not the talent develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer if the veterans are gone in a year or two that should be just about right open question which was more important to the expansion clubs the expansion draft or the regular draft they ' ve had one of each i think dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic
well since you mentioned it no question here chip in the masterson as well yep if you asked me qqq days ago i ' d agree with you i now give the nod to raymond bourque his play took off the same time the b ' s did chelios gets a close second barrasso finally gets his due in a close one over eddie the eagle in your case that bias is acceptable mine shows with the norris pick so we ' re even i ' m impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did but my pick would be al arbour not too many folks thought the isles would be in the playoffs let alone contend for qqq in their division granted that they did have a little help from their cousins on broadway and i like the islanders about as much as i like mowing my lawn .
such as ?
as the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not batting qqq for the giants behind will clark barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league imho to have williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting qqq ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the giants .
during the regular season when the intensity is down not many teams have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of the opposing teams net and the inadequacy of the leafs defense in this regard thus did n ' t matter however the playoffs are a different story every good team is going to have players who are going to become potted plants in front of potvin and the leafs relatively unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept hard work will go a long way during the regular season almost to qqq points and the leafs deserve credit for that but in the playoffs talent matters because everyone begins working hard .
i watched the final inning of bosio ' s no hitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he would n ' t have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded and if he failed to field it cleanly would it or should it have been an error or a hit judging from bosio ' s grimace when the ball bounced past him he must have thought it would go through for a hit whether vizquel was right or wrong he certainly made one hell of a play phil brown aka qqq |
the other jewish hof ' er is rod carew who converted lowenstein is jewish as well as montana ' s only representative to the major leagues undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish between stone koufax ken holtzman might have the wrong pitcher i ' m thinking of the one who threw a no hitter in both the al and nl and big ed reulbach that ' s quite a starting rotation moe berg can catch harry steinfeldt the qqq in the tinkers evers chance infield is stanky jewish or is that just a dave cohen kinda misinterpretation whatever does n ' t look like he stuck around the majors too long .
and dino ciccarelli and ray sheppard and so on and so on )
as far as i can tell he was right next to bassen do n ' t you guys love it when people like me come out of the woodwork qqq )
sorry again i guess you need my address .
look asshole i got him confused with somebody else i did n ' t flame you and i would appreciate it if you extended me the same courtesy no i do n ' t know everything in the world does that surprise you ?
the blackhawks shall triumph .
good question it ' s my impression not backed by evidence that general south of the borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring firing effect i was talking about back in the qqq ' s there were some attempts to hire black cuban ballplayers they were rejected by the commissioner and others well what did i mean to say aside from some short lived exceptions such as japanese internment in ww ii only blacks were affected by laws regarding slavery jim crow miscegenation military service etc if my claim of exclusivity is not qqq airtight that is if you can come up with this or that exception fine have a cookie but compared to this list no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth discussing at length .
you could be right then again you could be wrong this claim is completely unverifiable and untestable i ' d wager most of the braves fans on the net could name more than qqq players from their qqq season you could give away tickets to braves games however my dad and i were able to get great seats from scalper for face value which is n ' t exactly the sign of a hot ticket this is precisely why they were considered america ' s team even especially when they were bad you could see most of the braves games on cable you could do that for the cubs as well but the braves had better camerawork better announcers what would you rather listen to harry discuss the game or skip and pete discuss motoball and teams that were n ' t too much worse because of tbs the braves had a lot of fans outside of georgia at home in kentucky even though we were much closer to cincinnati there was as many braves fans as reds fans even in qqq you could actually watch the braves play you had to go to cincinnati to watch the reds i can go anywhere in america and watch the braves why i ' d guess that braves fans are more widely distributed than toronto fans dale j stephenson steph @ cs . uiuc . edu baseball fanatic

geez everyone comes up with clark williams thompson these guys were all up in qqq that ' s ancient history so in the last qqq years noone right beck does n ' t count i said qqq solid years let ' s see what he does w / o the help of a pitchout every other pitch as i remember even bob brenly had a good throwout percentage under roger craig who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown out of course he suffered from qqq ball qqq strike homers a lot too i am not a big fan of manwaring .
i really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year ' s playoffs to me i mean the obviously superior toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing what gives i stand by all the misstatements that i ' ve made vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson qqq
for those of you who read tv guide there ' s an article in next week ' s sportsview concerning the nhl and major network broadcasting pretty interesting .
well i do n ' t recall assuming anything except perhaps that the columnist who reported the incident was telling the truth i . e the sarcastic impression came from _ him _ steve simmons besides to my knowledge alex has a pretty fair grasp of the english language and his recent comment after the detroit game would indicate that this remark _ is _ what i think it to be very low .
can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door i must have stared at cleman in the mets box for a good qqq seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was would n ' t it make more sense to use colemn ?
stuff about ron gant incident deleted i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him however what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games you are the first person non mediot i have seen endorse this policy i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd and other announcers bitching about it i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up if i cough up big bucks for a ticket i do n ' t mind a game that last more than qqq i really do n ' t understand it games are longer now for several reasons more pitching changes more basestealing and throws to first etc i think a very small factor is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter ' s box my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games they get to head back to hotel bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar sure they want the game over with print journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games they have deadlines the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy they constantly harp on this primarily because they often have to work late when the game goes longer than qqq maybe i am just a ne ' er do well with nothing better to do but i would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you as a parenthetical note it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year the increased offense thus far will certainly spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly .
oh lighten up what depresses me is that they might actually finish last which i believe has n ' t happened since their second season in qqq never mind that gubizca is qqq qqq with a qqq era gardner at qqq our main recent acquisitions lind mcreynolds jose are averaging qqq david cone is qqq qqq about how he was doing in kc before joining the mets several years ago our hitting sucks and our pitching has collapsed and we ' ve won one game at home they ' ve won more games in their first ten games than last year and brian mcrae is actually batting over the mendoza line !
punch imlach ' s contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than those of the above combined should we name a division or trophy after him smythe and norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners as owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether are we going to honour those who contributed to the league ' s evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself i ca n ' t disagree with you here what have you heard the major was the definitive little asshole he originated the phrase if you ca n ' t beat ' em in the alley you ca n ' t beat ' em on the ice that was his idea of hockey do you think by chance that don cherry is a classy individual the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice exactly true naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame i have always thought that this was nonsense -

was n ' t ron bloomberg the former yankee who got the first base hit by a designated hitter jewish ?
the runner can leave his base at any time if the ball is caught he ' s got to tag up if it is n ' t caught he _ does n ' t _ have to tag up at all so if he ' s feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up if it is n ' t caught he ' s probably scored a run if it is he ' s probably headed for aaa the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on base all other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up .
does anyone know if msg will televise any of the binghampton rangers playoff games even taped replays would be nice ?
um the header said career hodapp managed about qqq pa in his nine years in the majors as for his consistently over qqq make that three years in a row preceded by a part time year plus his last year with boston hodapp only qualified for the batting title five times was he injured he retired right around his qqq birthday anyway hodapp put up flashy numbers the year everybody put up flashy numbers that was his only really good year with a bat his other qqq years were marred by a lack of power and an inability to draw walks only qqq of those qqq pa were bases on balls which does not describe a feared hitter on the other hand he was part of the long line of famous cleveland qqq wambsganss riggs stephenson etc .
i ' d be willing to make two wagers qqq snow does n ' t win roy qqq mattingly is out of baseball within five years i ' m skeptical of the first because i do n ' t think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team i ' m skeptical of the second because of his back mattingly is qqq this year and how many players play until they are qqq not too many and most of them did n ' t have chronic back problems when they were qqq could be wrong on either or both but i think that ' s the smart way to bet .
first of all i think when espn covers the game they do a wonderful job but last night i felt the same way i really hate watching devils pens game everyone knows that devils are going to get their ass kicked why even bother showing them i was so bored and these espn people do n ' t seem to have any brain after the sundays and last night games they are still going to show devils pens on thu and sun what the hell are they thinking about i think if they keep it up like this nhl will never get a major network contract i ' d rather see caps isls game which is more exciting now i just hope all baseball games are rained out on espn so atleast we can get diffrent hockey games .
i definitely do that ' s why i do n ' t like going to see games played on artificial turf well your idea of interesting differs from mine i think batting practice is interesting for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it i think the delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are interesting because they ' re attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game of course the umpires can and should intervene when these tactics get out of hand as ryan robbins has pointed out there are rules that cover this one of the more fascinating things about baseball i think is its open endedness with regard to time you never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if it ' s going to go on until four in the morning likewise some games are action packed and some games are slow and lazy that ' s fine by me those folks who want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention spans .
ca n ' t we just stick this guy in the faq and stop responding to him guys the last several flame wars with him have been pretty much identical could someone just collect all the articles from this one and simply re post the entire block whenever he tries to start one it ' d be simpler roger apparently is one of those embarassing specimens who enjoys flames why give him what he wants oh roger you ' re dull very dull you should get a new act .
hi does anybody know the for ticket info for fenway thanks
i ' m not quite sure how these numbers are generated it appears that in a neutral park bo ' s hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs or do they what is equivalent average one thing when looking at bo ' s stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers normally you expect some would be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway but bo despite his speed hit very few doubles and not that many triples so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park felix jose has been a qqq player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the qqq bo at around a qqq player maybe qqq not even close i ' d put him about there too note i had n ' t realized the media had hyped him so much i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only so so at baseball he did only have one qqq qqq season and kc was n ' t winning note qqq i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcn ' s as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error sometimes a player with poor mle ' s dave justice the qqq ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some do n ' t oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe did n ' t hit and shane did it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball their backgrounds are similar what has n ' t been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly it has n ' t been established that you can use mle ' s with two sport players it has n ' t been established that you ca n ' t but then statistics is after all an art i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton look at those good but not great minor league numbers they say well what happens if those numbers simply do n ' t mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half year in atlanta than greenville then again it might not ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mle ' s but you guys don ' t know what ' s worse you do n ' t know that you do n ' t and you do n ' t know that there are other players you wo n ' t know about injuries and lifting and wheaties again you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal it ' s not it ' s got some error oh well bill guilford

yes that ' s him was i not specific enough just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that they have a quick bat dawson ' s release is slow and he is qqq after all he may swing early and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to the left side all the time but he swings slowly as for me disagreeing with peter gammons whoa that ' s never happened before next thing you know i ' ll probably believe dave campbell is the biggest imbecile even to come near a mic and that ray knight has the iq of drained crankcase oil .

maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and there ' s going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now what would happen at gm where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game forget it word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon .

gee you ' d think winnipeg would be tops on that list what with qqq regulars being european well being a jet fan i sometimes wish that bure would get knocked silly too nothing serious just enough to keep him out of a game in most cases the owners have very little to do with it they give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft find me the best players so that our team will win the stanley cup whether that player is in kindersley saskatchewan or chelyabinsk russia if the gm believes him to be the better player the gm should be drafting him where do you get off calling the nhl their league when referring to canadian players it does n ' t belong to them it belongs to the owners the owners can do what they want while a canadian content rule might be enforcable here in canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us that the cfl sorry for the football reference did n ' t even try to push their import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers increasing the competition for the elite positions in most cases would make players better anyways oh yeah and how many europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in north america while there are some that play in the ahl or the ihl where that ' s an nhl team ' s primary farm club you do n ' t hear of many europeans playing in the chl the echl or on the secondary farm teams in the ihl ie the jets do have a few russian players in moncton but i do n ' t believe there are any europeans in ft wayne so with all those teams there are plenty of positions for hockey players in north america i ' m in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the world i ' ve grown up with europeans playing on my team and some of those players were the among the best in the world from hedberg nilsson and sjoberg to sel { nne zhamnov and olausson and all those in between and to come i would n ' t have it any other way .
i stopped going to a ' s games some years ago while i still lived inthe bay area for exactly this reason i believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by larussa duncan they encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study the catchers signals and so on and almost every a ' s hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch this is not imo a coincidence this is planned and i hate it as for the gant situation i did not see the game or the replays but i do wonder what if gant had requested a time out would hirschbeck have been required to give it to him could he have denied the requst for all he the ump knew gant could have had dirt in his eye .

look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the maple leafs and a certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport guess what they were immensely popular at the gate the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row ha such humor they have major fan problems namely that on occasion some of them do n ' t make it home from the match the soccer fans tend to be fanatical much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically - jpc -
are there any further stories to report on the eve of norm ' s farewell from the twin cities in an earlier post it was announced that norm green was given until midnight of the last home game of the north stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena did this happen was norm run out of town rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board the score board fell to the ice and flattened mr greedy to a large piece of green paper arena management had to use the zamboni which they confiscated from norm ' s truck to clean up the useless remains .

nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge to sweden in creating more opportunities second period action saw tommy

had their minds in the dressing room a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game canada played a very disciplined defense ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense lindros played a lot and played well sanderson naturally game hero with two goals the forsberg naslund bergqvist line sweden ' s best along with larsson juhlin nilsson swedish defense played well qqq cm qqq kg peter popovic had the task of neutralizing qqq cm qqq kg eric lindros and managed this very well ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering

is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians and where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans do nt say that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game i mean look at the way you play these days less fights and more hockey imho canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the qqq ' s when the game was more brute than beauty oh look you do n ' t like finns either too bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe hmmm and what kind of a name is rauser does n ' t sound very canadian to me )
i ' ve never seen a game where one player has committed qqq penalties something like this would require more attention by the referee but you ' re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before i can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it ' s obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities if a basketball team scores qqq points that ' s at least fifty chances made the average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is probably around qqq and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe qqq of them you have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba game you attended was that play was stopped too often would n ' t your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game ?

up to this point i really thought this had been written by a pro sdcn anti mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for sarcasm and biting remarks somebody like me for instance the lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the original poster but then the scales were lifted from my eyes looks like robert is really being serious oh well i compare the performance of the qqq phillies with the qqq edition which had outstanding run producers at every position except ss yet finished at a frustrating qqq level the qqq folks did n ' t ever amount to anything and neither will the qqq squad imho any other parallels with previous years teams for this year ' s editions in the style of qqq braves qqq orioles greg mockingbird franklin interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more qqq than mingling between qqq races robohen
well the jettison for youth fast strategy was his also in hindsight it did n ' t work all that well but i think it was more because it left the sharks on a tightrope without a net not that it was inherently flawed it was the injuries that caused us to fall from all indications it was n ' t the major factor but the last straw there were personality conflicts among shark management and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled not just who was being traded vs kept but who was being sent to kc what ferriera did if rumors are right was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed i think if they ' d kept ferriera they would have lost some of their other management staff depending on which sources you trust we might have lost grillo and lombardi and murdoch over the summer frankly i want to keep those three we may well ahve also lost kingston which of course is now a moot point the sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative ferriera wanted to run things his way there were conflicts ferriera lost that says nothing about his skills or accomplishments at that level a lot is personality and politics i think he did some good things for the sharks but that he never fit in as a shark person i hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in anaheim too because it ' ll be good for hockey but i want the ducks to be doormats for a couple of years so the sharks succeeed first .
not if you ' ve scored four runs you do n ' t why strain even the best pitching staff why not make it easier for them in the qqq qqq game the best pitching staff in the world ca n ' t compensate for a blown call a bad hop a gust of wind winning close is the wrong way to win both keeping opposing runs down and scoring a lot yourself are insurance against the shit happens aspect of baseball not every great teamhas even good pitching the big red machine of the qqq ' s was league average in pitching but somehow rose morgan bench perez etc managed to win qqq games more than once peaking at qqq .

no problem no offence taken it is sad just as a lover of the sport that this team can be in the metro new york area for over a decade and still exist as just a non entity we ' re getting the sabres bruins as the replacement game and probably so are you while the devils penguins game is played on scny and the islanders caps are the overflow game on the sca scny plus if the sabres bruins ends early then we ' ll go to the devils penguins game assuming that espn follows their previous patterns we got the last minute of the islanders rangers and all of the overtime two weeks ago espn ' s coverage started last night by accident but as one or more other writers have pointed out they could ' ve gone to wild hog wrestling for the evening instead gld

i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here if you asked somone who had never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think that the response would be what if you asked this person if la played in the west division the naming of divisions after long dead entrepreneurs is unnecessary obfuscation hardly the established situation existed prior to smythe et al the stanley cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge what our dear founders did was formalize the challenge they created a closed league an oligop olistic professional system in the interests of making money wheth er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable we are however stuck with their invention and that de bate is academic the point to be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before smythe and his pals showed up what ' s wrong with best defenceman period was there ever a better defenceman was there ever a better player and if you think that bruce norris contribution was somehow more significant than bobby orr ' s then in the interests of education why do n ' t you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris was but you do n ' t have to do you so you do n ' t feel that you should have to make the effort to remember that vancouver plays in the west division or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen and of course you neatly deleted jason ' s jingoistic rant about the game losing its canadianization quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it does mine my position is clearly progressive and is anything but biased closed minded ig norant arrogant i will grant you nice try john but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display at least enough intelligence to earn your target ' s respect cordially as always rm
what sadist brought up this vein about malarchuk when i saw what happened i wanted to throw up and at the same time i was devastated since i thought that malarchuk would n ' t survive btw i believe he picked up an alcohol problem after before the incident to radically change the subject the caps must be having nightmares about the isles in overtime in the playoffs have they ever beaten the islanders in a playoff ot game this is lunacy the caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating losing two ot games in a row is not coincidence it ' s evidence of the choke factor .

actually they ' re pretty worthless if you want to evaluate players with stats rbis and runs scored should be banned all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself you uh so you ' ve just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored that ' s where obp slg runs created linear weights etc come in these simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player ' s offensive contribution to the team ' s runs scored thank you for making our case have a nice day .

however batters did n ' t use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree they do now everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games the rule that hirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time nobody including hirschbeck ever said he was that ' s your perhaps colored by your partisanship of the braves perception hirschbeck ' s view was that gant was heading off for a long walk and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up directed him into the batter ' s box the point is based on the rulebook and the umpires instructions it was not an unreasonable request the braves were already upset had gant done as instructed you would n ' t have remembered the name of the umpire .

hopefully epsn will use the lesson given by the master ted turner the season ted introduced tnt many cable co ' s refused to put it on saying that gee we get enough old movies miniseries etc on tbs usa amc wgn wor why do we need another one this was in the fall come spring ted fixed their little red wagons good the previous spring nba playoffs wore on tbs now they were on tnt and still are and everyone gets tnt now so espn should put nfl football and baseball on qqq and leave hockey on espn and if cable co ' s play games and drop espn in favor of qqq espn should alternate baseball and football between channels every week but do the espn guys collectively have the gonads of the turner guy ?

the phillies salvaged their weekend series against the chicago cubs by beating them qqq qqq in a wild one at wrigley field sunday afternoon it was the phils only win in the three game series and was the first time the phillies have lost a series in the young season the phils jumped to a qqq qqq lead in the game thanks to qqq john kruk qqq homers and two wes chamberlain homers however danny jackson and the phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead mitch williams entered the game with the phillies leading qqq qqq however candy maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it in the qqq dave hollins hit a three run shot his first of the year to push the phils ahead to stay however in a shaky bottom of the qqq the cubs scored qqq runs and had the tying runner on base when the cubs pinch hit randy myers for bob scanlan they were out of position players and myers bunted into a double play to end the game .
the giants always hit maddux well but it was interesting that maddux did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night he threw qqq straight fastballs over the plate to bonds in the qqq last night got away with the first one but bonds hit the second one out of the park then in the qqq when clark was at third base with one out maddux did not intentionally walk bonds and bonds dropped a single to left center the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet he will always hit around qqq but i ' m concerning about his on base percentage the key in the lineup is matt williams he has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl burba has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher from last year however swift is terrible in both of his starts with burba moving into the rotation mike jackson is the only right handed reliever aside from rod beck he ' ll get a lot of actions i also hope that dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially on beck i was concerned when beck was used for qqq straight days earlier this week so far so good !
